[{"question": "Tell me about Yelan", "answer": "Yelan is a 5-star Hydro bow user in Genshin Impact who excels as a sub-DPS or off-field DPS, making her perfect for applying Hydro and triggering powerful elemental reactions like Vaporize, Electro-Charged, or Freeze while supporting your main damage dealer. Her playstyle revolves around dealing consistent Hydro damage while off-field, enabling other characters to shine as the main DPS. This makes her extremely flexible and valuable in a wide variety of team compositions. Her main source of damage comes from her Elemental Burst, Depth-Clarion Dice, which summons a Hydro-infused die that follows your active character and deals damage whenever they perform a Normal Attack. This effect continues even after you switch characters, which means Yelan can support your team even while she\u2019s not on the field. Her Elemental Skill, Lingering Lifeline, lets her dash around, marking enemies in her path and dealing Hydro damage once the dash ends. This not only offers solid crowd control but also mobility to escape danger or quickly reposition. To build her effectively, your focus should be on Energy Recharge and HP-based stats to scale her Burst damage and ensure it\u2019s always ready. The best artifact set for her is the 4-piece Emblem of Severed Fate, which boosts both Energy Recharge and Elemental Burst damage. For main stats, use Energy Recharge or HP% on the sands, Hydro DMG Bonus on the goblet, and Crit Rate or Crit DMG on the circlet, depending on your weapon and sub-stats. Sub-stats should prioritize Crit Rate, Crit DMG, Energy Recharge, and HP%. When it comes to weapons, her best-in-slot is the 5\u2605 Aqua Simulacra, which gives Crit DMG and increases her HP and damage. For 4\u2605 options, Favonius Warbow is great for generating energy and helping the whole team recharge their Bursts, while The Stringless boosts her Skill and Burst damage directly. Even 3\u2605 bows like Slingshot can work well early on if you have good aim and are just starting out. Yelan\u2019s passive talents further boost her effectiveness: one increases her damage based on her Max HP, another gradually increases your active character\u2019s damage while her Burst is active, and her exploration passive reduces stamina consumption while sprinting\u2014a small but helpful bonus when exploring Teyvat. She shines when teamed with characters who can take advantage of her Hydro application. Pyro characters like Hu Tao, Xiangling, and Yoimiya are great for Vaporize teams. Electro units like Raiden Shogun and Fischl enable Electro-Charged, and Cryo characters like Ganyu or Ayaka can trigger Freeze. Yelan pairs especially well with characters who use fast Normal Attacks to fully utilize her Burst\u2019s effect. Even without any constellations, Yelan is already a top-tier support character. Her C1 adds a second charge to her Skill for extra Hydro application and mobility, while C2 and beyond boost her overall damage. C6 turns her into a main DPS by allowing her to fire special charged arrows rapidly during her Burst. In battle, a typical rotation involves using her Elemental Skill to dash and build energy, followed by her Elemental Burst, then switching to your main DPS to deal reaction-based damage while her Hydro die continues to strike. With this playstyle, Yelan provides consistent damage and support, making her easy to use and highly effective\u2014even for new players. Overall, Yelan is a stylish, powerful, and versatile character who adds tremendous value to any team. Whether you're just starting out or a veteran player, investing in Yelan ensures you have a reliable Hydro support who keeps your enemies soaked and your team shining."}, {"question": "Tell me about Jean", "answer": "Jean is a 5-star Anemo character who wields a sword and serves as the Acting Grand Master of the Knights of Favonius in Mondstadt. She\u2019s known for her sense of duty and hard work, and her character reflects the ideal balance between strength and care. In gameplay, Jean is a flexible unit who can serve as a healer, crowd controller, or even a physical damage dealer depending on how you build her. She\u2019s especially useful in teams that need consistent healing or a bit of everything in one character. Jean\u2019s talents are straightforward yet powerful. Her normal attack, Favonius Bladework, strikes up to five times in a combo. Holding down her charged attack unleashes a powerful slash at the cost of stamina. Her Elemental Skill, Gale Blade, summons a small storm that pulls enemies toward her and throws them when released. Holding the skill allows for better control of where enemies land, and throwing them into walls causes bonus damage. Her Elemental Burst, Dandelion Breeze, is a healing-and-damage combo that heals all party members based on her attack stat and deals Anemo damage to enemies around her. It also creates a healing field that persists and launches enemies inside it. Jean\u2019s passive talents boost her utility further. Wind Companion gives her normal attacks a 50% chance to heal all party members based on her attack, providing steady healing during regular combat. Let the Wind Lead regenerates 20% of her energy when she uses her Elemental Burst, making her healing ability available more often. Guiding Breeze increases the chances of double output when crafting healing items, which is a nice bonus for resource management. There are two main ways to build Jean: as a healer/support or as a physical damage dealer. Her healing scales with her ATK stat, so in a support build, focusing on ATK% is key. Equip her with a 4-piece Viridescent Venerer artifact set for boosting Swirl reactions and reducing enemy resistances. Weapons like Freedom-Sworn, Favonius Sword, Sacrificial Sword, or the craftable Prototype Rancour work well, depending on whether you want more energy, cooldown resets, or attack stats. If you want to use Jean as a physical DPS, you can equip her with 2-piece Bloodstained Chivalry and 2-piece Pale Flame or 4-piece Gladiator\u2019s Finale to increase her physical damage. Focus on CRIT Rate/DMG, ATK%, and Physical DMG Bonus for her main stats. While this playstyle is less common, it\u2019s surprisingly viable with the right investment. Jean\u2019s versatility makes her an easy fit into many teams. She synergizes well with Pyro characters like Xiangling or Diluc to trigger Anemo Swirl reactions and spread elemental effects. She also pairs well with Electro characters like Fischl or Raiden Shogun to benefit from more energy generation and extra reaction damage. Cryo characters can also be great allies, enhancing her crowd control capabilities and boosting reaction potential. Though Jean is great even at C0 (no constellations), unlocking constellations makes her even stronger. C1 boosts movement and attack speed after using her Burst, making her team more agile. C2 reduces damage taken and lowers enemy resistance. C4 helps with energy regeneration through her normal attacks, and C6 adds Anemo infusion to healed allies, boosting their elemental damage temporarily. In summary, Jean is one of the most dependable characters in Genshin Impact. Whether you\u2019re just starting or already deep into the game, she offers healing, crowd control, and decent damage\u2014all in one character. She fits into nearly any team and helps reduce downtime with her powerful healing and supportive abilities. If you\u2019re lucky enough to have her, she\u2019s absolutely worth investing in."}, {"question": "Tell me about Sucrose", "answer": "Sucrose is a 4-star Anemo Catalyst user who excels at supporting your team through crowd control and reaction amplification. As an alchemist from Mondstadt, she specializes in bio-alchemy and brings that expertise to the battlefield by increasing your team\u2019s Elemental Mastery, making her an ideal support for reaction-heavy team compositions. If you're new to Genshin Impact and looking for a flexible, reaction-boosting support, Sucrose is a fantastic and budget-friendly choice. Her Elemental Skill, 'Astable Anemohypostasis Creation - 6308', summons a small Wind Spirit that pulls enemies together and deals Anemo damage. This ability is great for both grouping mobs and triggering Swirl reactions with other elements. Her Elemental Burst, 'Forbidden Creation - Isomer 75 / Type II', releases a larger spirit that continues to move and swirl around, dealing Anemo damage over time and absorbing one element (Pyro, Hydro, Cryo, or Electro) to deal additional elemental damage of that type. Both her Skill and Burst are powerful tools for spreading elemental effects and controlling the battlefield. What truly sets Sucrose apart is her Elemental Mastery scaling and her ability to share it with teammates. Her passive talent, 'Mollis Favonius', boosts the EM of characters who match the element she Swirls by 20% of her own EM. This makes her incredibly valuable in teams focused on reactions like Vaporize, Melt, Overloaded, or newer Dendro-related reactions such as Quicken and Hyperbloom. Another passive, 'Astable Invention', gives her a chance to double-craft character and weapon enhancement materials\u2014bonus utility outside of battle. When it comes to weapons, Sucrose benefits most from Elemental Mastery or support-focused catalysts. The 3-star Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers is surprisingly powerful, offering a huge ATK boost to the next character after she swaps out. Sacrificial Fragments is another excellent choice, providing EM and a chance to reset her Skill cooldown for more Swirls. For more advanced or niche setups, Mappa Mare or Hakushin Ring can also work depending on your team. For artifacts, your best bet is a 4-piece Viridescent Venerer set. This not only enhances her Anemo damage and Swirl power, but it also reduces the elemental resistance of enemies to the element Swirled\u2014boosting your main DPS\u2019s output even further. For main stats, go full Elemental Mastery on Sands, Goblet, and Circlet to maximize Swirl and her EM-sharing potential. Until you can get a full Viridescent set, mixing 2-piece sets with EM or Instructor can be a good placeholder. Her Constellations aren\u2019t necessary for her to function, but they do add value. C1 gives her an additional Skill charge, C2 increases her Burst duration and improves crowd control, and C6 gives a significant Elemental Mastery bonus to the whole team after she uses her Burst. If you plan to use her often in reaction teams, these constellations can be very impactful. Sucrose fits beautifully into teams focused on Elemental Reactions. She pairs especially well with Pyro, Hydro, and Electro characters. Popular teams include Hu Tao + Xingqiu + Sucrose for Vaporize, or Raiden + Fischl + Sucrose + Dendro unit for Aggravate or Hyperbloom. She can even serve as a driver in Electro-Charged teams, triggering reactions while supporting from the field. In summary, Sucrose is a top-tier 4-star support that new players should absolutely consider building. Her ability to group enemies, trigger powerful Swirl reactions, and buff your team\u2019s Elemental Mastery makes her a valuable addition to many team comps. She's flexible, easy to build with 3-star weapons, and incredibly impactful when used correctly. With just a bit of investment in Elemental Mastery, Sucrose can become the backbone of your reaction-based team. "}, {"question": "Tell me about Kazuha", "answer": "Kazuha is a 5-star Anemo (wind) sword user from Inazuma, known for his graceful playstyle and powerful team buffs. As one of the most versatile and effective support characters in the game, Kazuha brings immense value to almost any team. Whether you're new to Genshin Impact or just pulled him from a rerun banner, this guide will walk you through how to build and play him efficiently. Kazuha\u2019s role is primarily that of an Anemo support or sub-DPS. His job is to boost your team's elemental damage, group enemies together, and trigger Swirl reactions that deal AoE damage. His Elemental Skill, Chihayaburu, can either be tapped for a quick lift or held for a stronger suction effect that pulls enemies in and launches Kazuha into the air. From there, you can perform a Plunge Attack, which deals AoE Anemo damage. If your skill absorbs an element like Pyro, Hydro, Electro, or Cryo, the plunge attack will deal additional elemental damage based on that element. His Elemental Burst, 'Kazuha Slash', is one of the best team utility abilities in the game. It creates a swirling Anemo field that absorbs an element it comes into contact with and continues to deal AoE elemental damage over time. This skill has an 8-second duration and a 15-second cooldown, giving it good uptime. More importantly, it triggers Swirl constantly, which is key to Kazuha\u2019s strength. One of Kazuha\u2019s most important features is his Ascension 4 passive, which grants your team a bonus to elemental damage based on his Elemental Mastery (EM). Every time he triggers a Swirl, your team gains a damage bonus to the element Swirled, scaling at 0.04% per point of EM. This might sound small, but it adds up quickly\u2014especially since Kazuha can Swirl multiple elements and has high EM. For example, at 800 EM, he grants 32% elemental damage bonus, which is massive for any elemental DPS. Because of this, the most effective way to build Kazuha is by focusing on Elemental Mastery. Although his abilities scale with ATK and Crit too, stacking EM not only improves his personal Swirl damage but also enhances your whole team\u2019s output. Swirl is a transformative reaction, which means it scales with Kazuha\u2019s level and EM\u2014not his ATK or Crit\u2014so it's highly recommended to prioritize EM unless you're building him for niche DPS roles (which is uncommon and less efficient). To get the most out of Kazuha, you should level him to 90, since Swirl damage is based on character level. For talent priority, max his Elemental Burst first, followed by Normal Attack (for plunge scaling) and Elemental Skill. Even though Kazuha is a support, leveling his talents improves his grouping and damage efficiency. When it comes to artifacts, there\u2019s really only one top-tier option: the 4-piece Viridescent Venerer set. It increases Anemo damage, boosts Swirl damage, and more importantly, reduces enemy resistance to the Swirled element by 40%. This makes it an incredibly strong support set for any Anemo character, and especially for Kazuha, who can Swirl multiple elements in one rotation. For main stats, aim for: Sands: Elemental Mastery or Energy Recharge (if needed) Goblet: Elemental Mastery Circlet: Elemental Mastery For substats, prioritize Energy Recharge (until you can consistently use your Burst), Crit Rate (if using Favonius Sword), and any extra EM or offensive stats. Speaking of weapons, Kazuha\u2019s best-in-slot is the Freedom-Sworn sword, which boosts EM and increases team damage when you trigger a reaction. However, it's a 5-star limited weapon and not necessary. A fantastic 4-star option is the Favonius Sword, which generates energy particles for your team and helps reduce Kazuha\u2019s energy needs. Just remember\u2014you\u2019ll need a bit of Crit Rate to trigger its passive. If you don\u2019t have that, Sacrificial Sword is another strong pick, letting you reset his Skill and Swirl more often. Finally, Iron Sting is a great free-to-play option, offering decent EM and reaction-based damage. Kazuha fits into almost every elemental team, especially those that rely on reactions. He's amazing with Pyro, Hydro, Cryo, or Electro DPS characters. Teams like Xiangling + Xingqiu, Raiden Hypercarry, Hu Tao Vaporize, Ganyu Melt, and even Freeze teams with Cryo carries like Ayaka or Rosaria all benefit from Kazuha\u2019s Swirls and buffs. He\u2019s also useful in teams that don\u2019t rely heavily on reactions, such as Mono-element setups, where he buffs a single element with massive impact. When playing Kazuha, always aim to Swirl the right element to buff your main DPS. For example, if you're playing Hu Tao, Swirl Pyro. In a Freeze team, Swirl Cryo. Kazuha can even double Swirl in some teams\u2014swirling Hydro and Pyro at the same time, or Electro and Hydro in Taser comps\u2014buffing both elements. This makes him extremely valuable in multi-element reaction teams. In terms of constellations, Kazuha is already incredibly strong at C0. You don\u2019t need any constellations to make him shine. However, C2 is particularly powerful\u2014it grants 200 Elemental Mastery to both Kazuha and your team when you use his Burst. This turns him into a pseudo-Sucrose and significantly boosts team damage. C1 gives a small quality-of-life cooldown reset, while C6 allows him to become a main DPS with Anemo-infused attacks, though it changes how you build and play him. To sum it all up, Kazuha is one of the most powerful, flexible, and fun support characters in Genshin Impact. He makes any elemental team better with his Swirl damage, team buffs, and crowd control. He\u2019s incredibly easy to build around Elemental Mastery and works well with both budget and high-end setups. Whether you're running him in Freeze, Vaporize, Taser, or Mono-element teams, he\u2019s always going to be an asset\u2014and once you start playing him, you'll see why he's considered one of the best 5-stars in the game."}, {"question": "Tell me about Sayu", "answer": "Sayu is a unique and fun support character in Genshin Impact who excels at healing, swirling elements, and rolling around the battlefield. For a new player, understanding how to build her might seem complicated at first, but once you get a grip on her mechanics, she becomes one of the most versatile and enjoyable units to use. Her healing is the most important part of her kit and comes primarily from her Elemental Burst, which summons a Daruma that heals allies and damages enemies based on her attack stat. However, Sayu also heals when she triggers Swirl reactions thanks to one of her passive talents, which scales with Elemental Mastery. That\u2019s why building her with Elemental Mastery not only improves her Swirl damage but also boosts the healing from those reactions. Her Elemental Skill, which lets her roll around and deal Anemo damage, can be held or tapped. Holding it deals more damage and generates more energy particles, making it very useful when used correctly. Ideally, you should briefly hold and then release to get the most out of it without waiting for the full cooldown. For artifacts, the best set for Sayu is the 4-piece Viridescent Venerer, which increases Anemo and Swirl damage and reduces enemy resistances to the element you swirl. This makes her especially powerful in teams that rely on elemental reactions. Stat-wise, focusing on Elemental Mastery for all three main artifact pieces\u2014Sands, Goblet, and Circlet\u2014is generally optimal for both damage and healing. However, if you find her healing lacking, you can replace the Circlet with a Healing Bonus one. Energy Recharge is also very important for her to use her Burst consistently, so try to find it in sub-stats or use an Energy Recharge weapon to make up for it. Weapon-wise, Sayu benefits most from Energy Recharge claymores like the Favonius Greatsword or Sacrificial Greatsword. These help her regain energy more efficiently so she can keep healing. If you already have enough Energy Recharge from artifacts, you can opt for an Elemental Mastery weapon like Rain Slasher or even a simple three-star Bloodtainted Greatsword. High-end options like Wolf\u2019s Gravestone or Skyward Pride also work great if you have them, but they\u2019re not necessary for her to function well. In terms of team compositions, Sayu can either be the centerpiece in a team that revolves around her rolling skill\u2014especially effective when combined with Xiangling\u2019s Pyronado\u2014or act as a general Anemo support like Jean. She\u2019s very flexible and can fit into many reaction-based teams, particularly those that benefit from Swirl and need a reliable healer. She works well with characters like Fischl, Xiangling, or Xingqiu, who can provide continuous elemental application for her to swirl. Even in teams where the main carry isn\u2019t Anemo, she can help boost their damage by reducing resistances and keeping the team healthy. Sayu is great at what she does even at Constellation 0, though her Constellation 1 gives a big quality-of-life boost by letting her Daruma heal and attack at the same time. Her Constellation 6 is also fantastic, turning Elemental Mastery into a stronger stat for both healing and damage. But even without any constellations, she\u2019s perfectly functional and enjoyable. Overall, Sayu is a fantastic support character with a playful kit, making her a great pick for both new and veteran players. She adds a lot of utility, mobility, and fun to any team she\u2019s in, and with the right build, she can become an invaluable part of your lineup."}, {"question": "Tell me about Wanderer", "answer": "Wanderer, also known as Scaramouche, is a powerful and stylish Anemo DPS character who thrives on being the center of attention in a team. As a new player, understanding how to use him can be a bit overwhelming at first, but once you grasp the mechanics of his unique kit, he becomes one of the most fun and flashy characters in Genshin Impact. The core of Wanderer\u2019s kit revolves around his Elemental Skill, which lifts him into the air and allows him to hover while performing enhanced Normal and Charged Attacks. During this mode, he gains a special stamina-like bar that depletes with actions like attacking or dashing. His attacks in this state are significantly buffed, and this is where the bulk of his damage comes from. He also has passives that add to this kit\u2014when he swirls certain elements like Pyro, Hydro, Electro, or Cryo during this mode, he gains buffs such as bonus ATK, Crit Rate, Energy generation, or more hover time. This allows for interesting synergies with elemental support characters that can pre-apply these elements before he enters his skill. His Elemental Burst, while flashy and satisfying, is more of a bonus than a core part of his rotation. It costs 60 energy and deals a burst of AoE Anemo damage, but you don\u2019t need to use it every rotation. Instead, you can focus on keeping his skill up and weaving in the burst every other rotation when energy allows. Talent-wise, leveling his Normal Attack first is crucial, followed by his Skill. His Burst should be your last priority unless you have Constellation 2, which directly buffs it. Artifact-wise, Wanderer's best set is the Desert Pavilion Chronicle. This 4-piece set buffs Anemo damage, increases attack speed, and gives a massive boost to Normal, Charged, and Plunging Attack damage after a Charged Attack hits\u2014perfect for his playstyle. If you don\u2019t have access to that, a good alternative is the Shimenawa\u2019s Reminiscence set, which also buffs attacks significantly but drains energy, making it harder to use his Burst frequently. Two-piece mixes of Anemo Damage Bonus and ATK% sets also work well if you\u2019re starting out or don\u2019t want to farm a specific domain. Stat-wise, prioritize ATK% on the Sands, Anemo DMG Bonus on the Goblet, and Crit Rate or Crit DMG on the Circlet, balancing based on your weapon. Energy Recharge is not a major focus since his Burst isn\u2019t core to his rotation, but a little can help if you want to use it more often. When it comes to weapons, his signature 5-star catalyst is naturally the best, giving him Crit stats and damage boosts tailored to his kit. However, he has many viable alternatives. Crit-based weapons like Lost Prayer or Kagura\u2019s Verity work well, while 4-star options like The Widsith, Solar Pearl, and Dodoco Tales (if you have it) are excellent budget picks. These all offer good offensive stats and effects that mesh well with his damage output. Even if you missed event weapons, Blackcliff Agate or the Map of Mare can be used in a pinch, though they are slightly weaker. In terms of team comps, Wanderer can function in a few distinct roles. Most commonly, he\u2019s played as a hypercarry surrounded by buffers like Faruzan (who boosts Anemo damage and shreds resistance), Bennett (for his massive ATK boost), and someone like Layla or Zhongli for shielding. Faruzan is a very important unit for maximizing Wanderer\u2019s damage, although she can be difficult to build at low constellations due to her high Energy Recharge needs. Alternatively, you can use Wanderer as a \u201cdriver\u201d in taser-style teams with supports like Fischl, Xingqiu, Yelan, or Beidou, where he swirls and triggers reactions while dealing damage through Normal or Charged Attacks. Ultimately, Wanderer is incredibly versatile and very enjoyable to play. His fast-paced, aerial combat feels unique, and while he lacks interruption resistance, pairing him with a shielder can solve that issue. Whether you want to build a team around his swirling style or run him as a reaction enabler, he can shine in many compositions. He\u2019s viable at C0 and scales well with constellations, especially C2 and C6, but doesn\u2019t require them to be effective. For a new player looking for a flashy and satisfying on-field DPS, Wanderer is a fantastic and rewarding choice."}, {"question": "Tell me about Lynette", "answer": "Lynette is a four-star Anemo support character who offers a mix of utility, swirl support, and a special mechanic called *Usia-aligned damage*, making her especially useful in Fontaine content. As a new player, she\u2019s an excellent free character to help you learn about reaction-based teams and Anemo utility, all while fitting into a wide variety of team compositions. Her Elemental Skill can be pressed or held. A tap performs a quick hit of Anemo damage with surprisingly good scaling, while holding lets her dash around before striking a marked enemy. When her thrust lands, she heals a portion of her HP instantly, then drains some current HP over time, which usually results in a net HP gain. This HP-drain mechanic also synergizes with Fontaine-specific artifact sets and weapons. The skill also generates energy particles and, importantly, applies Usia-aligned damage. This is useful against certain Fontaine enemies and bosses, especially those that have mechanics or shields tied to Usia or Pneuma alignment. Her Elemental Burst is a summoned cat-shaped box that deals AoE Anemo damage and continuously applies swirl to enemies nearby. It can infuse with Pyro, Hydro, Cryo, or Electro based on what it touches first, and it also taunts enemies. The taunt isn\u2019t perfect but is more reliable than most due to the burst\u2019s durability and 12-second duration. It costs 70 energy, so building Lynette with enough Energy Recharge is important to use it consistently. Additionally, she has passive talents that give your whole team bonus ATK (based on how many different elements are in your team) and boost her Burst\u2019s damage when it\u2019s infused with an element. When building Lynette, the 4-piece Viridescent Venerer set is almost always the go-to choice. It\u2019s perfect for any Anemo support, increasing Anemo damage and boosting your team\u2019s elemental damage by shredding enemy resistance to swirled elements. If another Anemo support on your team is already using that set, or if you want to focus on Lynette\u2019s own damage, you can use other sets like Noblesse Oblige for burst support or Emblem of Severed Fate for energy-heavy builds. As for stats, aim for Energy Recharge on the Sands (if you need it), Anemo DMG Bonus on the Goblet, and Crit Rate or Crit DMG on the Circlet. Substats should focus on ER (until you can burst comfortably), Crit, and ATK%. Elemental Mastery is also viable if you want to boost her swirl damage, especially in reaction-heavy teams. For weapons, Lynette has two main paths: support-oriented swords that help with energy, and offensive swords that boost her personal damage. Sacrificial Sword and Favonius Sword are her top-tier four-star options. Sacrificial can give her a second Skill use, which means more particles and damage, especially at higher refinements. Favonius Sword generates team-wide energy particles when Lynette crits, helping both her and her teammates recharge faster. If you\u2019re looking for damage, weapons like Festering Desire, Finale of the Deep, or the new Battle Pass sword Wolf-Fang are solid picks. Five-star options like Freedom-Sworn or Mistsplitter Reforged work too, but aren\u2019t necessary\u2014her four-star options are already great. Team-wise, Lynette is extremely flexible. She fits well into any team that benefits from swirl reactions. This includes Vaporize, Overload, Freeze, Electro-Charged, and Hyperbloom comps. She supports characters like Hu Tao, Xiangling, Ayaka, Yelan, Xingqiu, Fischl, and Beidou by swirling their elements and reducing enemy resistances. She\u2019s especially valuable in teams that lack a top-tier Anemo support like Kazuha or Sucrose, giving newer or free-to-play players access to swirl utility without needing to pull for rarer characters. In Fontaine, her Usia-aligned damage gives her an edge in certain domains and against special bosses. If you have her sixth constellation, she can even serve as a main on-field driver in taser-style teams, swirling Hydro and Electro while dishing out respectable damage herself. Overall, Lynette is a well-rounded, free Anemo unit who brings a lot to the table. She\u2019s not as powerful as five-star Anemo supports like Kazuha or Venti, but she has a unique niche with her Usia-aligned mechanic, solid personal damage, good energy generation, and flexible team compatibility. Whether you\u2019re building her as a pure support, a hybrid sub-DPS, or even a driver at C6, she\u2019s a very worthwhile investment\u2014especially for newer players building their first reaction-focused teams."}, {"question": "Tell me about Lyney", "answer": "Lyney is a five-star Pyro bow user with a unique and stylish playstyle centered around charged shots. Unlike many bow characters who are reaction-based or focused on elemental skills, Lyney is all about spamming Level 2 charged attacks for strong single-target Pyro damage. His gameplay feels a bit like Ganyu\u2019s in terms of mechanics, but instead of ice blooms, Lyney fires powerful \u201cProp Arrows\u201d that can spawn pyro-hatted companions, deal extra damage, and create AoE when detonated. His kit is elegant but has specific team and stat needs, so building him right is key to unlocking his full potential. The core of Lyney\u2019s playstyle is his Level 2 charged shot. Firing this not only deals high damage but also consumes a portion of his HP if he\u2019s above 60%, creating a \u201cProp Surplus Stack\u201d and summoning a Grin-Malkin Hat. These hats taunt enemies and eventually explode to deal bonus Pyro damage\u2014this damage scales with his charged attack stat, meaning it benefits directly from the same buffs. Lyney\u2019s Elemental Skill consumes all stacks to do AoE Pyro damage and heals him based on HP lost, making it a clean way to reset his HP while also contributing to damage. His Elemental Burst turns him into a cat-like performer that dashes around dealing Pyro damage and ends with a large AoE blast. You can cancel it early to get the final hit faster, which is useful for optimizing rotations. One of Lyney\u2019s most important passives gives him up to 100% bonus damage against enemies affected by Pyro, scaling higher the more Pyro teammates are in the party. Because of this, he thrives in mono Pyro teams, where his bonus can shine. Adding non-Pyro characters who overwrite Pyro reactions\u2014like Hydro or Cryo\u2014diminishes his potential, so his teams are built more around maintaining constant Pyro aura than chasing vaporize or melt reactions. For artifacts, Lyney\u2019s best-in-slot is the 4-piece *Marechaussee Hunter* set. The 2-piece bonus boosts his Normal and Charged Attack damage, and the 4-piece gives him up to 36% Crit Rate whenever his HP changes, which it does constantly through his own mechanics and healing. This set is basically tailor-made for him and works incredibly well, as long as you\u2019re rotating properly and keeping HP fluctuations going. If you don\u2019t have this set yet, viable substitutes include Lavawalker for Pyro-specific damage, Wanderer\u2019s Troupe for charged shot power, or even Vermillion Hereafter if you\u2019re willing to manage its burst-related bonuses. Main stats should be ATK% Sands, Pyro DMG Bonus Goblet, and Crit DMG or Crit Rate Circlet, depending on your weapon and overall Crit ratio. Aim for around 120\u2013140% Energy Recharge if you plan to use his Burst every rotation. Weapon-wise, Lyney has great flexibility. His signature 5-star weapon, The First Great Magic, is his best option, boosting charge shot damage and scaling attack with more Pyro teammates. Aqua Simulacra is close behind with massive Crit DMG. Other 5-star bows like Thundering Pulse or Polar Star also work well, though the latter can overcap Crit Rate. On the 4-star side, his best free-to-play weapon is *Prototype Crescent*, which gives huge ATK boosts on weak point hits\u2014great if you can aim reliably. Battle Pass bows like The Viridescent Hunt or the new Scion of the Blazing Sun also perform well, particularly in single-target fights. Even options like Blackcliff Warbow or Song of Stillness are serviceable if you\u2019re building around their strengths. Team-wise, Lyney shines in mono Pyro comps. His best support is Bennett, who provides ATK buffs, healing, Pyro resonance, and enables frequent HP fluctuations to trigger artifact effects. For defensive utility, Zhongli is ideal thanks to his shield and resistance shred. You can also run other Pyro defensive units like Dehya (with her resistance to interruption), or even Xinyan if you\u2019ve built her. As a flex support or buffer, Anemo units like Kazuha or Sucrose can swirl Pyro and boost his damage. Kazuha in particular is excellent due to his elemental damage boost. Shangling is another strong choice, offering tons of off-field Pyro damage and synergy with mono Pyro setups. Some niche choices include Lynette for swirl and taunt synergy or Layla/Kirara for off-element shielders who don\u2019t interfere with Pyro uptime. Overall, Lyney is a high-damage main DPS who scales incredibly well with the right team and setup. He\u2019s not the easiest character to play due to his reliance on aimed charged shots and his need for a stable team environment to maintain uptime on Pyro aura and buffs. But if you enjoy a more technical, sharpshooting style and can build around him with strong Pyro supports, he can be a very rewarding and powerful option\u2014especially when his best set and signature weapon come into play."}, {"question": "Tell me about Freminet", "answer": "Freminet is a 4-star Cryo claymore user who offers a refreshing twist on Genshin Impact\u2019s combat system through a pressure-based combo mechanic. Instead of relying on elemental reactions like Melt or Freeze, Freminet is built around dealing strong physical damage, complemented by periodic Cryo application. His Elemental Skill is the heart of his kit\u2014it activates a state called *Pers Timer*, during which his normal attacks generate pressure. When that pressure reaches Level 4, his Skill deals bonus Cryo and heavy physical damage, making for a satisfying burst of power at the end of his combo loop. This system encourages rhythmic play and gives Freminet a unique flow, rewarding players who like precise timing and consistency over quick swapping or reaction-heavy bursts. His Elemental Burst is more of a supportive tool\u2014it deals AoE Cryo damage and resets the cooldown of his Skill, letting you quickly jump back into the combo loop. Though it\u2019s not his primary damage source, it\u2019s still useful for keeping up Cryo application and helps maintain rotation flow. His passive talents also tie into his kit neatly, increasing his ATK after hitting opponents with his Skill, and enhancing damage when triggering Shatter. While Shatter isn't the focus of his kit, it adds a bit of bonus damage if you have Hydro or Geo teammates that can freeze enemies. Freminet\u2019s constellations enhance his gameplay without fundamentally changing it, offering a balance of quality-of-life improvements and raw power boosts. His **C1**, *Dreams of the Seething Deep*, gives him a 15% Crit Rate buff for 5 seconds after using his Skill\u2014an easy-to-trigger bonus that makes building Crit stats easier and improves his consistency early in rotations. **C2**, *Penguins and the Land of Plenty*, raises his Skill level by 3, directly buffing the damage of his core combo, especially the powerful explosion at Pressure Level 4. **C3**, *Song of the Eddies and Bleached Sands*, increases the Burst level by 3, which helps but isn\u2019t as impactful since the Burst isn\u2019t his main damage source. **C4**, *Dance of the Snowy Moon and Flute*, is a big gameplay improvement\u2014it extends his *Pers Timer* state and allows an additional pressure stack, making it easier to hit Level 4 and keeping him in his high-damage state longer. **C5**, *Nights of Hearth and Happiness*, adds 3 levels to his Normal Attack talent, further enhancing his pressure-generating swings. Finally, **C6**, *Moment of Waking and Resolve*, is his strongest power spike, massively increasing the explosion damage of his Level 4 pressure release by adding 80% of his ATK and 200% of his Physical DMG Bonus. This turns his final hit into a devastating strike that feels truly rewarding to land. When building Freminet, the best artifact set is the 4-piece *Pale Flame*, which increases physical damage and boosts ATK when his Skill hits enemies. This synergizes perfectly with his pressure-loop playstyle. If you\u2019re missing good Pale Flame pieces, a 2-piece combo with *Bloodstained Chivalry* is a solid fallback. For stats, aim for ATK% on the Sands, Physical DMG Bonus on the Goblet, and Crit Rate or Crit DMG on the Circlet, depending on your overall ratio. You can run some Energy Recharge in substats to help with Burst uptime, but it\u2019s not a priority. He doesn\u2019t scale with Elemental Mastery, so focus purely on offensive stats. Freminet\u2019s best weapon for F2P players is the craftable *Snow-Tombed Starsilver*, which fits both thematically and mechanically. It boosts physical damage and has a decent ATK stat. *Serpent Spine* is also a top-tier 4-star option if you manage its passive with shields. Among 5-stars, *Song of Broken Pines* is his best choice, offering a Physical DMG bonus and team ATK buff. *The Unforged* or *Redhorn Stonethresher* are also viable, though Redhorn's DEF scaling isn\u2019t ideal. *Prototype Archaic* is a good early-game alternative if you don\u2019t have access to better options. Team-wise, Freminet shines as an on-field physical DPS in superconduct-focused teams. Pairing him with Electro characters like Fischl or Raiden Shogun allows you to reduce enemy physical resistance, boosting his damage. Diona is a strong Cryo support option, offering shielding, healing, and Cryo resonance. Zhongli is arguably the best defensive pick, giving you strong shields and reducing enemy resistance. You can also consider characters like Mika, who directly buffs physical damage, or Rosaria, who helps with Crit Rate and resonance. Freminet stands out from other 4-stars by delivering a focused, timing-based playstyle with strong physical DPS potential. He\u2019s not the most flashy or flexible unit, but for players who enjoy controlling a main carry with consistent, rhythmic output and a satisfying combo payoff, Freminet offers something genuinely fresh. While his full potential shines most with some constellations\u2014especially C1 for Crit, C4 for better uptime, and C6 for huge finishers\u2014he\u2019s more than capable of handling his role at C0 with the right build and team."}, {"question": "Tell me about Albedo", "answer": "Albedo is a 5-star Geo sword user who excels as an off-field sub-DPS, delivering consistent and reliable damage through his Elemental Skill while requiring very little field time or energy. He\u2019s incredibly low-maintenance and efficient, making him a valuable asset in a variety of team comps\u2014especially those that benefit from off-field Geo application or need a solid second DPS for split teams. His playstyle is simple but effective, and he's especially appealing to players who want to set-and-forget a source of damage while focusing on their main DPS. Albedo\u2019s Elemental Skill, *Abiogenesis: Solar Isotoma*, creates a Geo construct that deals AoE Geo damage every 2 seconds when enemies inside its field are hit. These damage instances, called *transient blossoms*, scale entirely with Albedo\u2019s DEF, which makes building him straightforward and efficient. The construct also generates energy and acts as a small platform, which can be used for vertical mobility. It\u2019s worth noting that this skill persists even if you swap characters, allowing Albedo to deal consistent damage from off-field. His Elemental Burst, *Rite of Progeniture: Tectonic Tide*, is a quick Geo slash that deals AoE Geo damage and spawns several small Geo blooms (Fatal Blossoms) if Solar Isotoma is active. It scales with ATK, unlike his Skill, but it's still useful for a bit of burst damage and crystalize reactions. Albedo's constellations improve his overall consistency and damage output. **C1**, *Flower of Eden*, gives energy when blossoms trigger, making his Burst much easier to use regularly. **C2**, *Opening of Phanerozoic*, adds a stacking 15% DEF bonus when your characters gain crystals from the Crystallize reaction, directly boosting his Skill damage. **C3** increases his Skill level, and **C4** buffs your active character\u2019s plunge attack damage, which is niche but fun in Xiao teams. **C5** boosts his Burst level, and **C6** adds a powerful mechanic: when Albedo triggers a Transient Blossom, his Elemental Mastery increases by 125 for 10 seconds\u2014great in reaction-based teams like Sunfire or Geo-overload variants. While he\u2019s excellent at C0, his constellations\u2014especially C1 and C2\u2014add nice quality-of-life and damage improvements without drastically changing how he\u2019s played. For artifacts, Albedo\u2019s best set is the **4-piece Husk of Opulent Dreams**, which provides DEF and Geo DMG Bonus. It synergizes perfectly with his Skill scaling and is ideal for maximizing his off-field damage. If you haven\u2019t farmed Husk yet, you can also use a **2-piece Archaic Petra + 2-piece Husk** combo or **2-piece DEF% sets** until you get better pieces. For stats, prioritize **DEF% on Sands**, **Geo DMG Bonus on the Goblet**, and **Crit Rate or Crit DMG on the Circlet**, depending on your weapon. Substats should focus on Crit Rate, Crit DMG, and DEF%. You don't need Elemental Mastery or ATK%, since his Skill doesn't benefit from those. In terms of weapons, Albedo\u2019s **best-in-slot 4-star weapon** is the **Cinnabar Spindle**, which was a free event sword tailored for him. It boosts his Skill DMG based on DEF, making it perfect if you got it during the event. If not, **Harbinger of Dawn** is a strong 3-star option with high Crit DMG and Crit Rate at full HP. It\u2019s extremely efficient and often outperforms even some 5-star options for Albedo. Other decent picks include **Festering Desire** or **Freedom-Sworn** if you're running him in reaction-based comps, though they aren\u2019t optimal for his usual DEF-scaling build. Team-wise, Albedo fits seamlessly into many lineups. He\u2019s a staple in **double Geo teams**, often paired with **Zhongli** for resonance and shields. He also works beautifully with **Xiao**, whose plunge attacks benefit from Albedo\u2019s off-field damage and occasional Burst buffs. Albedo fits into **mono Geo teams** with characters like **Itto**, **Gorou**, and **Ningguang**, providing consistent background DPS and energy. You can also slot him into **reaction teams** like **Sunfire (Jean + Bennett)** or **overload comps**, especially if you run him at C6 for the bonus Elemental Mastery. Because he generates energy, requires minimal field time, and can be built with cost-effective weapons and artifacts, Albedo is one of the most plug-and-play sub-DPS characters in the game. Overall, Albedo is a prime example of a sub-DPS who brings reliable value to nearly any team. He doesn\u2019t need a fancy rotation, rare gear, or high investment to perform well. His constellations improve his role further but aren\u2019t necessary. For players looking to boost team damage without micromanaging another active unit, or for those who need a solid off-field contributor in Abyss split teams, Albedo is a smart and satisfying choice."}, {"question": "Tell me about Ninghuang", "answer": "Ningguang is a 4-star Geo catalyst user who functions best as a burst-focused main or sub-DPS. She\u2019s known for her ability to deal high Geo damage, scale well with investment, and even serve as a carry in both early and late-game content. Ningguang\u2019s unique mechanic revolves around her Jade Screen and her charged attacks, allowing her to output strong single-target damage while remaining one of the more stylish and satisfying characters to play. Her playstyle is clean, straightforward, and rewarding for players who enjoy positioning and quick bursts of damage. Her Elemental Skill, **Jade Screen**, creates a wall of Geo energy that blocks projectiles and scales with her Max HP, but most importantly, it serves as a buffing tool. When Ningguang fires a charged attack through the screen, the damage is amplified. This is key to optimizing her damage output. Jade Screen also applies Geo and can be used strategically to create shields when crystallizing with other elements. Her **Elemental Burst**, **Starshatter**, unleashes a flurry of homing gems that deal high Geo damage to enemies. If her Jade Screen is present when she casts her Burst, it will fire additional gems, massively increasing damage. This synergy makes her burst combos particularly potent when set up correctly. Ningguang\u2019s **constellations** enhance her kit in meaningful ways, especially if you plan to use her as your primary or secondary DPS. **C1**, *Piercing Fragments*, allows her Normal Attacks to deal AoE damage\u2014nice for group fights. **C2**, *Shock Effect*, reduces the Elemental Skill cooldown when the screen is shattered, giving you more frequent access to her screen buff and energy generation. **C3** increases her Burst level by 3, directly improving her most important source of damage. **C4**, *Exquisite be the Jade, Outshining All Beneath*, grants all party members a 10% Geo DMG bonus when they pass through the screen\u2014very useful in mono Geo teams or with other Geo supports. **C5** boosts her Normal Attack talent, and **C6**, *Grandeur Be the Seven Stars*, causes Ningguang to spawn 7 Star Jades after using her Burst, which can be unleashed instantly with a Normal Attack for big follow-up damage. This constellation significantly increases her burst combo and flow, making her feel smoother and much more powerful as a main DPS. For artifacts, Ningguang\u2019s best set is **2-piece Archaic Petra + 2-piece ATK% (like Gladiator\u2019s or Shimenawa\u2019s)**. This combination gives her Geo DMG and flat ATK%, both of which are crucial since her damage scales off ATK and Geo Bonus. For more personal damage at higher investment, you can also run **4-piece Archaic Petra**, especially if you\u2019re supporting with elemental pickups for team buffs, or **4-piece Retracing Bolide** if you're consistently shielded (e.g., with Zhongli). As for main stats: use **ATK% Sands**, **Geo DMG Bonus Goblet**, and **Crit Rate or Crit DMG Circlet**, depending on your weapon and ratio. Substats should focus on Crit, ATK%, and some Energy Recharge. Weapon-wise, Ningguang benefits a lot from weapons that offer Crit stats and ATK bonuses. Her **best-in-slot 5-star weapon** is **Lost Prayer to the Sacred Winds**, which boosts Crit Rate and increases Elemental DMG over time, suiting her on-field DPS role. **Memory of Dust** is also strong, especially with shields, offering ATK stacking. **Solar Pearl**, a Battle Pass catalyst, is one of her best 4-star options, providing both Crit Rate and Normal/Burst DMG increases. **The Widsith** is another excellent choice\u2014it\u2019s a stat stick that grants rotating buffs, and Ningguang can capitalize on whichever she gets thanks to her short rotations. For F2P players, **Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers** isn\u2019t ideal unless she\u2019s built purely as a support, so something like **Twin Nephrite** or **Mappa Mare** can be temporary options. Team-wise, Ningguang is very flexible. She performs well in **mono Geo teams**, often paired with **Zhongli**, **Albedo**, or **Gorou** if you\u2019re using multiple Geo units. Zhongli is especially valuable for his shield and resistance shred, which lets Ningguang focus entirely on damage. Ningguang also fits into **Geo-Charged teams** with Fischl, Beidou, or Xingqiu, who can provide off-field damage while she executes her burst combos. You can even build a dual carry comp with Ningguang and a character like Noelle or Yanfei, swapping in and out for big bursts. In short, Ningguang is a stylish and effective Geo DPS who can shine with relatively low investment and scale beautifully with constellations. She has a straightforward kit that\u2019s easy to learn and rewarding to master, offering a clean, bursty playstyle and fantastic synergy in Geo-heavy comps. Whether you\u2019re looking for a dependable sub-DPS or a full-fledged main DPS, Ningguang delivers with elegance and power."}, {"question": "Tell me about Zhongli", "answer": "Zhongli is a 5-star Geo polearm user who excels as the strongest defensive support in Genshin Impact while also offering solid burst and sub-DPS utility. His most defining feature is his **unmatched shield strength**, which not only protects your team but also shreds enemy resistances, making him a universal fit in nearly any team composition. Whether you\u2019re a new player looking for safety or a veteran building high-end Abyss comps, Zhongli provides immense value with minimal investment. His **Elemental Skill**, *Dominus Lapidis*, has two forms. A tap summons a stone pillar that deals AoE Geo damage and resonates with other Geo structures, dealing ticking AoE damage in a small radius. However, the most important use is holding the skill, which summons the same pillar while creating a **Jade Shield**\u2014the strongest shield in the game. This shield scales with Zhongli\u2019s Max HP, absorbs all damage types, and reduces **all enemy resistance** to both physical and elemental damage by 20% when enemies are near it. This makes him not only a tank but also a universal buffer for your entire team\u2019s damage output. Zhongli\u2019s **Elemental Burst**, *Planet Befall*, summons a giant meteor that crashes down, dealing massive AoE Geo damage and **petrifying** enemies, freezing them in place for a few seconds. The burst scales off ATK, but thanks to its wide range and crowd control effect, it\u2019s useful even without heavy investment. It\u2019s especially good in content like Abyss, where stalling enemy movement and applying crowd control can be invaluable. Zhongli\u2019s **constellations** further amplify his already versatile and powerful kit. **C1**, *Rock, the Backbone of Earth*, lets his pillar summon another one, increasing Geo resonance and area control\u2014great for teams with Geo units like Albedo or Itto. **C2** grants a shield to all nearby characters when his burst is used, providing more survivability for co-op or multi-character swap teams. **C3** boosts his Skill level, improving shield strength. **C4** boosts burst damage by 20% when shielded, making his nukes even scarier. **C5** increases Burst level, and **C6** grants a 40% HP boost to nearby characters when under the Jade Shield, synergizing especially well with HP-scaling units like Hu Tao, Nilou, and Yelan. Though he\u2019s very strong at C0, each constellation adds either defensive or offensive value that complements his role. When building Zhongli, you can go **full support**, **shield bot**, or **burst DPS**, depending on your needs. For **support builds**, the best artifact set is **4-piece Tenacity of the Millelith**, which increases shield strength and grants ATK to the team when his Skill hits enemies. It\u2019s perfect for maximizing utility and team-wide buffs. For **burst DPS** Zhongli, you can use **2-piece Archaic Petra + 2-piece Noblesse Oblige** or even **4-piece Noblesse** to boost his ultimate. If you're going for a **hybrid** approach\u2014decent shield and some damage\u2014you can mix HP% with Geo DMG Bonus and Crit. In most cases, you\u2019ll want **HP% on Sands**, **Geo DMG Bonus on the Goblet**, and **Crit Rate or Crit DMG on the Circlet**, depending on your weapon and team needs. Full HP% on all pieces is fine if you're purely building him for shields. Zhongli\u2019s **best weapon** depends on his role. If you\u2019re building for **shield support**, **Black Tassel** (a 3-star weapon with HP%) is shockingly effective and frees up 5-star weapons for other characters. For a **burst DPS** build, **Staff of Homa** is his best-in-slot, offering Crit DMG and HP-based bonuses that synergize with his kit. **Vortex Vanquisher** works well for shield-focused builds too, though it requires you to be shielded for the passive to work. Other solid options include **Favonius Lance** for team energy or **Deathmatch** for a balanced offensive build. Zhongli fits seamlessly into almost any team. He\u2019s the perfect partner for **fragile hypercarries** like Ganyu, Yoimiya, Hu Tao, or Wanderer who need uninterrupted uptime to deal damage. He also excels in **Geo-centric teams** with characters like **Albedo**, **Itto**, and **Ningguang**, providing resonance and Geo structure support. Even in **reaction-based comps**, where shields aren\u2019t always prioritized, Zhongli\u2019s resistance shred and control make him valuable. His presence ensures comfort, allowing players to dodge less and focus more on output. In conclusion, Zhongli is a one-man fortress who protects your entire team, shreds enemy resistance, and brings great AoE and CC with his Burst. He\u2019s insanely flexible, easy to build, and extremely powerful even at C0. Whether you use him as a defensive anchor, a burst nuker, or a hybrid of both, Zhongli elevates any team he\u2019s in\u2014making him one of the most universally valuable characters in Genshin Impact."}, {"question": "Tell me about Noelle", "answer": "Noelle is a 4-star Geo claymore user who offers a unique hybrid role\u2014she can serve as a **healer, shielder, and main DPS**, depending on how you build her. Early on, she\u2019s a beginner-friendly character thanks to her survivability, but with investment, Noelle becomes a powerhouse capable of dealing impressive AoE Geo damage while keeping your entire team safe and healthy. Her greatest strength is her independence\u2014she doesn\u2019t need specific team synergies or reactions to function, which makes her a reliable option for solo play or players with smaller rosters. Her **Elemental Skill**, *Breastplate*, creates a shield that scales with her DEF and also heals your team when she attacks enemies. The healing chance is not guaranteed unless she\u2019s on the field, so to reliably heal, you want to keep her active during the shield\u2019s duration. The shield also gives her solid survivability, especially when combined with Geo\u2019s natural defensive utility. Her **Elemental Burst**, *Sweeping Time*, is where her damage shines. It converts her Normal and Charged Attacks into AoE Geo damage and scales completely off her **DEF**, not ATK. During this state, Noelle becomes a field-dominating DPS, capable of clearing large groups of enemies with massive swings of her claymore. Noelle\u2019s **constellations** dramatically improve her performance, especially if you want to use her as a DPS. **C1**, *I Got Your Back*, ensures that her Skill\u2019s healing always triggers when she\u2019s on-field, making her more reliable as a healer. **C2**, *Combat Maid*, reduces her Skill cooldown when you land critical hits, helping you cycle shields and healing more frequently. **C3** raises her Skill level, strengthening the shield. **C4**, *To Be Cleaned*, restores energy when she defeats enemies during Burst, greatly improving her uptime. **C5** boosts her Burst level, increasing her core DPS skill. **C6**, *Must Be Spotless*, is a game-changer: it gives her **50% DEF to ATK conversion** during her Burst and doubles her attack speed. This transforms Noelle into a genuine carry and is the biggest power spike in her kit. With C6, she goes from a tanky support to a full-blown main DPS capable of clearing Abyss content with ease. When it comes to **artifacts**, Noelle\u2019s best set as a DPS is **4-piece Husk of Opulent Dreams**, which gives her DEF and Geo DMG Bonus\u2014both perfect for her kit. Before unlocking Husk, a good alternative is **2-piece Gladiator + 2-piece Husk** or **2-piece DEF% + 2-piece Archaic Petra**. If you\u2019re playing her as a pure support or healer early on, **4-piece Maiden Beloved** or **2-piece DEF% + 2-piece Healing Bonus** can work too, though that\u2019s not her strongest build long-term. For main stats, run **DEF% on Sands**, **Geo DMG Bonus on Goblet**, and **Crit Rate or Crit DMG on Circlet**, depending on your weapon. Substats should prioritize Crit, DEF%, and Energy Recharge for more frequent Burst uptime. Noelle\u2019s **best weapons** for DPS are those that enhance her DEF or Crit stats. Her **best-in-slot 5-star weapon** is **Redhorn Stonethresher**, which gives Crit DMG and increases DEF-based Normal and Charged Attack damage. It's made for her. If you don't have it, 4-star options like **Serpent Spine** (Battle Pass) offer Crit Rate and consistent DPS at the cost of survivability (manageable with her shield). **Whiteblind** is the best F2P choice\u2014it\u2019s craftable and increases both DEF and ATK when hitting enemies, aligning perfectly with her scaling. Other options include **The Bell** (for HP/shield-focused builds) or **Favonius Greatsword** (for energy utility), though they\u2019re more situational. Team-wise, Noelle is very **self-sufficient**, but there are ways to boost her effectiveness. For **battery support**, pair her with **Gorou**, who boosts DEF and Geo damage for other Geo characters and is especially strong in mono Geo comps. **Zhongli** is another ideal partner, offering resistance shred and the strongest shield in the game, allowing Noelle to stay in her Burst without interruption. **Albedo** can be added for additional off-field Geo DPS and resonance. Geo resonance (with two Geo units) increases shield strength and overall damage, making it a core part of many Noelle comps. If you don\u2019t have full Geo teams, characters like **Bennett** (for ATK buffs) or **Fischl** (for energy and off-field damage) can support her well. Overall, Noelle is a powerful and flexible unit who starts out as a tanky beginner-friendly support and scales into a full-fledged DPS with investment\u2014especially at C6. She\u2019s one of the few characters who can heal, shield, and carry your team all in one slot, which makes her perfect for players who enjoy solo-friendly playstyles or want a durable, consistent main DPS. Whether you\u2019re spinning claymores through waves of enemies or patching up your team mid-fight, Noelle always pulls her weight\u2014with style and strength."}, {"question": "Tell me about Xingqiu", "answer": "Xingqiu is a 4-star Hydro sword user and arguably one of the most valuable characters in Genshin Impact, thanks to his incredible **off-field Hydro application**, **damage reduction**, and **healing support**. Despite his humble four-star status, Xingqiu is a staple in many top-tier teams, including some of the strongest meta comps like **National Team**, **Taser**, **Hyperbloom**, and **Hu Tao vape teams**. His versatility, low field time, and synergy with a wide range of characters make him an essential unit for both new and veteran players. The centerpiece of Xingqiu\u2019s kit is his **Elemental Burst**, *Raincutter*. It summons Rain Swords that follow your active character and strike enemies when you perform Normal Attacks, dealing coordinated Hydro damage. These hits are fast, consistent, and perfect for triggering reactions like **Vaporize**, **Electro-Charged**, or **Bloom**. Raincutter also provides **damage reduction** and minor **healing** through the *Rain Sword* passive, making it not only offensive but also a subtle defensive tool. What makes his Burst especially powerful is that it persists when you swap characters, letting you unleash elemental reactions with whoever is on field\u2014be it Hu Tao, Yoimiya, or Raiden Shogun. His **Elemental Skill**, *Guhua Sword: Fatal Rainscreen*, creates Rain Swords that orbit him, reduce incoming damage, and heal slightly when they break. The skill itself also deals Hydro damage in front of him and generates energy, helping you recharge his Burst more quickly. While his healing is modest, it can help in keeping your team alive in light-damage scenarios. Combined with the damage reduction and interruption resistance, it helps make squishy carries feel more comfortable during high-pressure fights. Xingqiu\u2019s **constellations** scale his value significantly. He\u2019s strong at **C0**, but each constellation gives him meaningful upgrades. **C1** increases the number of Rain Sword hits from his Burst, giving you even more Hydro application and reaction potential. **C2** extends the duration of his Raincutter, making it easier to keep uptime on his Hydro application during rotations. **C3** raises his Skill level, which increases his damage reduction and healing. **C4** increases Hydro RES reduction, improving his team damage against enemies. **C5** boosts his Burst level\u2014this is huge, as it's his core skill. **C6**, one of the strongest 4-star constellations in the game, gives your active character a 50% chance to launch an extra Rain Sword strike when they Normal Attack\u2014effectively doubling his Hydro application and making him a near-perfect enabler in reaction comps. For **artifacts**, Xingqiu\u2019s best-in-slot set is typically **4-piece Emblem of Severed Fate**, which boosts his Energy Recharge and converts it into Bonus Burst DMG. Since his Burst is his main source of damage and it has a high cost, this set perfectly complements his strengths. If you don\u2019t have a full Emblem set, **2-piece Noblesse + 2-piece Heart of Depth**, or **2-piece ER + 2-piece Hydro DMG** are strong alternatives. For main stats, go with **Energy Recharge or ATK% Sands** (ER is usually better), **Hydro DMG Bonus Goblet**, and **Crit Rate or Crit DMG Circlet**, depending on your weapon and substats. Substats should focus on ER (until ~180\u2013200%), Crit, and ATK%. Weapon-wise, Xingqiu benefits most from **Energy Recharge swords** to keep his Burst ready every rotation. His best 4-star weapon is the **Sacrificial Sword**, allowing him to use his Skill twice in a row for double energy particles and damage reduction uptime. **Favonius Sword** is also excellent, especially for supporting the whole team with particle generation. For more offensive options, **Skyward Blade** is a top-tier 5-star weapon, while **Jade Cutter** and **Aquila Favonia** are viable Crit-based options. **Festering Desire** (event-exclusive) is also solid, and for pure F2P, **Skyrider Sword** or **Harbinger of Dawn** can work early on with proper ER from substats. Team-wise, Xingqiu is one of the most flexible supports in the game. He\u2019s the Hydro backbone of **National Team** (with Bennett, Xiangling, Chongyun/Raiden), the enabler for **Hu Tao** and **Yoimiya** to trigger constant Vaporize, and a core part of **Taser comps** (with Beidou, Fischl, and Sucrose/Kazuha). He also performs excellently in **Hyperbloom** teams with Dendro and Electro characters like Nahida and Raiden, enabling fast, reactive Bloom damage. In Freeze teams, he can be used with Cryo characters like Ayaka or Rosaria, though characters like Mona may be preferred for AoE Freeze. His flexibility allows you to slot him into almost any comp that benefits from fast, single-target Hydro application. Overall, Xingqiu is an incredibly powerful and flexible character who continues to define the meta long after his release. He brings excellent value to both low-spending and high-investment players, can function at C0, and only gets better with constellations. With unmatched Hydro uptime, defensive utility, and low field time, Xingqiu remains one of the best 4-star units in the game and an irreplaceable member of many of the strongest teams in Genshin Impact."}, {"question": "Tell me about Arataki itto", "answer": "Arataki Itto is a 5-star Geo claymore user who serves as a powerful **main DPS**, specializing in hard-hitting, rapid-swinging **DEF-scaling Normal and Charged Attacks**. He\u2019s the centerpiece of **mono-Geo teams** and brings an energetic, aggressive playstyle with some of the highest sustained damage in the game\u2014when built and supported properly. Itto thrives in compositions that amplify his DEF and Geo damage, and once his rotation starts, he becomes a fast-swinging claymore machine who tears through enemies with a barrage of supercharged hits. Itto\u2019s **Elemental Skill**, *Masatsu Zetsugi: Akaushi Burst!*, throws Ushi\u2014a small bull that taunts enemies and deals Geo damage on impact. Ushi also **generates stacks of Superlative Superstrength** whenever he hits an enemy or when he leaves the field after taking damage. These stacks are used to perform **charged Arataki Kesagiri slashes** without consuming stamina. Each slash deals Geo damage based on Itto\u2019s **DEF**, not ATK, which is why DEF becomes his most important stat. Ushi also generates energy, making it essential for maintaining Burst uptime. His **Elemental Burst**, *Royal Descent: Behold, Itto the Evil!*, is where the real show begins. It converts all of Itto\u2019s Normal and Charged Attacks into Geo damage, significantly increases his **attack speed**, and boosts his **ATK based on DEF**. During this mode, he uses up his Superlative Superstrength stacks for free charged slashes. This is Itto\u2019s highest damage window and the center of his playstyle\u2014you want to enter Burst mode, unload as many charged slashes as possible, and then rotate back into support characters until his Burst is ready again. Arataki Itto\u2019s **constellations** make him scale very well, though he is **fully viable at C0**. **C1**, *Stay a While and Listen Up*, increases his attack speed and lets Ushi generate an additional stack, smoothing his burst rotation. **C2**, *Gather \u2018Round, It\u2019s a Brawl!*, increases Geo resistance shred when using Charged Attacks\u2014this is a solid DPS boost. **C3** increases his Burst talent level, directly buffing his strongest damage. **C4** reduces Ushi\u2019s cooldown, improving uptime and energy generation. **C5** buffs his Normal Attacks. **C6**, *Arataki Itto, Present!*, gives him **100% Crit Rate** on his Charged Attacks and **adds 50% DEF scaling to each slash**, making it a massive spike in power\u2014one of the most explosive constellations in the game for a main DPS. For **artifacts**, Itto\u2019s best-in-slot is the **4-piece Husk of Opulent Dreams**. It gives 54% DEF and 24% Geo DMG Bonus at full stacks, and Itto can stack it easily during his rotations. The set perfectly complements his DEF-scaling kit and is always recommended for maximum performance. If you don\u2019t have a full Husk set yet, **2-piece Husk + 2-piece Archaic Petra** is a good fallback. For main stats, go with **DEF% on Sands**, **Geo DMG Bonus on Goblet**, and **Crit Rate or Crit DMG on Circlet**, depending on your weapon and Crit ratio. Substats should prioritize Crit, DEF%, and Energy Recharge (until around 120\u2013130%). Itto\u2019s **best weapon** is his signature claymore, **Redhorn Stonethresher**, which gives Crit DMG and increases DEF-scaling Normal and Charged Attack damage\u2014basically made for him. Other great 5-star options include **The Unforged** if you run him with a shielder, and **Skyward Pride** for burst uptime and a bit of team utility. Among 4-star weapons, **Serpent Spine** is excellent due to its Crit Rate and DMG buff, especially with consistent shielding. **Whiteblind** is his best F2P option\u2014it\u2019s craftable and increases both DEF and ATK when hitting enemies, perfectly suiting his scaling needs. In terms of team comps, Itto shines brightest in **mono-Geo teams**, especially with **Gorou**, his signature support. Gorou buffs DEF, Geo DMG, and even provides healing at C4, making him essential in full Geo teams. **Albedo** is another top-tier partner, dealing constant off-field Geo damage and generating energy with his skill. **Zhongli** adds shields and further resistance shred, allowing Itto to swing uninterrupted and hit harder. A classic and incredibly strong team would be: **Itto + Gorou + Albedo + Zhongli**. For budget or early-game teams, you can use **Noelle** as a shield support or even as a second DPS, and slot in **Geo Traveler** or **Diona** for battery/shield support if you lack Gorou or Zhongli. Overall, Arataki Itto is a stylish, satisfying, and powerful main DPS who rewards proper team building and rotation management. He brings excellent AoE Geo damage, scales very well with investment, and becomes a beast at higher constellations\u2014but even at C0, with the right setup, he\u2019s more than capable of clearing the hardest content in the game. If you like the feel of heavy, fast attacks and enjoy seeing huge Geo numbers flying across the screen, Itto is a blast to play and a fantastic addition to any Geo-oriented roster."}, {"question": "Tell me about Gorou", "answer": "Gorou is a 4-star Geo bow user who plays the unique role of a **dedicated support for DEF-scaling Geo characters**, particularly those like Arataki Itto, Noelle, and Albedo. While his usefulness may seem limited at first glance due to his niche design, he becomes an incredibly impactful character when used in the right team composition. Gorou\u2019s playstyle revolves around amplifying the potential of his Geo teammates by offering **DEF boosts**, **Geo DMG bonuses**, and **interruption resistance**, all of which are essential for maximizing the damage output of Geo DPS units who rely on their defense stat rather than traditional ATK scaling. Gorou\u2019s Elemental Skill, *Inuzaka All-Round Defense*, creates a banner field that provides different buffs depending on how many Geo characters are in your party. With one Geo unit, the field grants a DEF bonus. With two, it adds resistance to interruption, and with three, it grants a Geo DMG Bonus. These buffs scale dynamically with the team and remain active while the banner is on the field. This skill also generates energy particles, helping support the energy needs of heavy Burst users like Itto. His Elemental Burst, *Juuga: Forward Unto Victory*, extends these buffs in a mobile AoE field that follows the active character. It also launches periodic Geo projectiles that deal AoE damage, and the Burst\u2019s mobile nature ensures that his team benefits from his buffs even during movement-heavy combat. While Gorou functions perfectly well at C0, his constellations elevate his role from a pure buffer to a more complete team support. His first constellation gives a flat Crit DMG boost to active Geo characters during his Burst, which directly enhances the DPS of carries like Itto or Noelle. As you unlock more constellations, his support grows deeper\u2014particularly at C4, where he gains the ability to **heal active characters based on his DEF** while they stand in his Burst field. This addition makes Gorou capable of replacing a healer in mono Geo teams, offering sustain along with his standard buffs. His sixth constellation is especially powerful, providing a **35% DEF boost** to all nearby party members within his Burst, pushing his support potential to its peak and allowing DEF-scaling characters to reach their full damage potential. When building Gorou, you typically want to focus on **Energy Recharge** to ensure his Burst is always available, and **DEF%** to scale his healing if you\u2019re using him at C4 or above. His best artifact set is **4-piece Noblesse Oblige**, which allows him to further increase team ATK after using his Burst. Alternatively, **The Exile** can be used for extra particle generation if you need more energy for your team. His stat priorities should lean toward ER on the Sands, DEF% on the Goblet, and either DEF% or Healing Bonus on the Circlet depending on your needs. For weapons, **Favonius Warbow** is his best 4-star option, as it helps with team-wide energy generation. If you have the 5-star **Elegy for the End**, it boosts ER and provides an additional party-wide buff when its passive triggers, making it a great pick for a fully supportive Gorou. Gorou fits best in **mono Geo teams**, where he can fully activate all his buffs and maximize the value of his kit. He\u2019s the cornerstone of popular teams like **Itto + Albedo + Gorou + Zhongli**, where he buffs both Itto and Albedo while Zhongli provides powerful shields and further resistance shred. In this setup, Gorou not only batteries the team and boosts DEF-based damage but also heals and supports survivability if you\u2019ve unlocked his C4. His synergy with Itto is particularly strong\u2014he\u2019s essentially required to unleash Itto\u2019s full damage potential\u2014and he also works well with Noelle in similar ways. Ultimately, Gorou is a specialized but irreplaceable support unit who makes DEF-scaling Geo teams viable and powerful. He may not be a universal buffer like Bennett or Kazuha, but within his niche, he excels beyond expectations. With his easy rotation, strong off-field presence, and game-changing constellations, Gorou becomes the perfect companion for anyone running Geo-heavy compositions, elevating them from solid to exceptional with his presence."}, {"question": "Tell me about alhaitham", "answer": "Alhaitham is a 5-star Dendro sword user who functions as a powerful **on-field main DPS**, dealing fast-paced Dendro damage through a unique **projection-based kit**. His gameplay revolves around weaving Normal Attacks and skill casts to generate **Chisel-Light Mirrors**, which convert his attacks into **Dendro-infused projection slashes**. These slashes hit hard, scale with Elemental Mastery (EM), and trigger frequent **Dendro reactions** like Quicken, Spread, and Aggravate when paired with Electro or Hydro teammates. Alhaitham is ideal for players who enjoy **reaction-heavy, fast-hitting melee combat** with a cerebral rotation and high payoff. His **Elemental Skill**, *Universality: An Elaboration on Form*, launches Alhaitham forward and generates one Chisel-Light Mirror (or more, depending on conditions). These mirrors float behind him and convert his Normal, Charged, and Plunging Attacks into **Dendro damage**. They also unleash **projection attacks** periodically that scale based on his EM. You can have up to **three mirrors** at once, and managing them effectively is key to maximizing his damage. Using his Skill while already holding mirrors won\u2019t generate new ones, so **rotating properly to keep three mirrors active** during combat is an essential part of mastering his kit. His **Elemental Burst**, *Particular Field: Fetters of Phenomena*, creates a Dendro AoE field that deals multiple hits of Dendro damage. The number of hits and the energy cost depend on how many mirrors he has at the time of casting\u2014more mirrors = more damage and lower cost. After casting the Burst, all mirrors are consumed and regenerated after a short delay, allowing you to restart his mirror cycle. While his Burst isn\u2019t his primary source of damage, it complements his rotation well and provides big AoE Dendro output for mob fights. Alhaitham\u2019s **constellations** enhance his kit without being necessary. **C0** is fully viable and already strong. **C1** adds more Elemental Mastery scaling and boosts reaction damage slightly. **C2** gives a chance to generate mirrors passively with Charged Attacks, which makes mirror uptime more fluid. **C4** boosts his team\u2019s EM, offering some utility. **C6** is his biggest spike, massively increasing the number of projection attacks during mirror uptime and drastically boosting his overall DPS. However, most players will find **C0\u2013C2** more than enough to get great value from him, especially in Spread/Aggravate teams where his base kit already excels. For **artifacts**, Alhaitham\u2019s best-in-slot set is **4-piece Deepwood Memories**, which reduces Dendro resistance and boosts Dendro team damage. However, if another unit on your team is already holding Deepwood (like Nahida or Collei), then **4-piece Gilded Dreams** becomes his best personal damage option, increasing his EM and ATK based on team comp. His stats should focus on **Elemental Mastery**, especially if you\u2019re building around Dendro reactions, but **ATK% Sands + Dendro DMG Goblet + Crit Circlet** is also viable if you're aiming for spread damage. Hybrid builds that combine EM and Crit stats are the most optimal for well-rounded performance. Alhaitham has several strong weapon options. His **signature 5-star sword**, *Light of Foliar Incision*, offers Crit DMG and buffs his projection attacks based on EM and Crit Rate, making it his top pick. **Primordial Jade Cutter** and **Mistsplitter Reforged** are also strong Crit-based alternatives. For 4-star weapons, **Iron Sting** is his best free-to-play option, boosting EM and reaction damage, while **Xiphos\u2019 Moonlight** gives EM and ER scaling, helping with his Burst uptime. **The Black Sword** is another solid option if you\u2019re leaning into a Crit-heavy build with sustained on-field time. Team-wise, Alhaitham thrives in **Quicken-Spread** or **Hyperbloom** teams. He pairs incredibly well with **Electro units** like Fischl, Kuki Shinobu, or Raiden Shogun, who can trigger Spread or Aggravate reactions while providing off-field Electro. **Nahida** is a near-perfect partner, offering massive EM and consistent Dendro application. He also works well with **Hydro characters** like Xingqiu or Yelan in Hyperbloom teams, though these comps can be a bit more chaotic to manage. For shielding and resistance reduction, **Zhongli** or **Baizhu** can provide comfort and sustain, allowing you to stay on-field safely and maximize mirror uptime. Alhaitham is a **high-skill, high-reward Dendro DPS** who rewards thoughtful rotations, mirror management, and reaction synergy. He offers a deep yet satisfying kit with impressive scaling and flexibility. With proper investment and the right teammates, Alhaitham can easily anchor a Dendro-focused team and dish out competitive damage in all types of content. If you enjoy fast swordplay, reaction-based combat, and a clever resource system, Alhaitham is a fantastic and rewarding addition to your roster."}, {"question": "Tell me about Kaveh", "answer": "Kaveh is a 4-star Dendro claymore user who offers a unique playstyle centered around **Bloom reactions**, AoE Dendro damage, and team utility. He stands out among Dendro units for his ability to **detonate Dendro cores** created by Bloom reactions, transforming what is usually passive damage into something proactive and visually explosive. Kaveh\u2019s strength lies in his synergy with Hydro characters, his ability to apply Dendro consistently, and his natural compatibility with **Hyperbloom** or **pure Bloom** teams. For players who enjoy reaction-focused gameplay with flair and style, Kaveh is a fun and accessible option. Kaveh\u2019s **Elemental Skill**, *Artistic Ingenuity*, deals AoE Dendro damage and triggers all **Dendro cores** (from Bloom reactions) within range to explode instantly. This makes him one of the few characters who can actively **control the timing of Bloom detonation**, adding an extra layer of strategy. The Skill also applies Dendro, helping maintain reaction chains when paired with Hydro units. His **Elemental Burst**, *Painted Dome*, is the heart of his kit. It enhances his Normal, Charged, and Plunging Attacks with Dendro infusion for a duration, boosts their damage based on his Elemental Mastery (EM), and causes Dendro cores to explode when they come into contact with him. During this Burst state, Kaveh becomes a true **Bloom driver**, rapidly triggering core explosions while delivering Dendro damage with each swing of his claymore. While Kaveh can be played at **C0**, his **constellations** significantly improve both his personal damage and his team support. **C1** grants Dendro RES and makes him more durable when inside his Burst. **C2** gives Energy and reduces his Skill cooldown, making his rotations smoother. **C4** increases his damage based on the number of Bloom reactions triggered by the team, adding a natural scaling mechanic. **C6** is his most impactful constellation\u2014it massively boosts the damage of Dendro core explosions based on Kaveh's EM, letting him scale into a powerful AoE Bloom DPS. For players interested in Bloom-focused team compositions, reaching even C2 or C4 can greatly enhance Kaveh's comfort and output. When it comes to **artifacts**, Kaveh benefits most from **Elemental Mastery**. His best artifact set is **4-piece Flower of Paradise Lost**, which is tailor-made for Bloom users, increasing both his EM and Bloom reaction damage. If you haven\u2019t farmed this set, **2-piece EM + 2-piece EM** (like Gilded Dreams, Wanderer's Troupe, or Paradise mix) is a solid alternative. For main stats, prioritize **EM on Sands, Goblet, and Circlet**, since both his core explosions and empowered attacks scale with it. Substats can also include some Energy Recharge to help maintain Burst uptime. Kaveh\u2019s **best weapons** are those that provide Elemental Mastery. His top 4-star option is **Mailed Flower**, a free event claymore that gives EM and ATK after triggering reactions\u2014perfect for his kit. **Makhaira Aquamarine** is another solid choice, offering EM and bonus ATK based on EM. **Raincutter** or **Forest Regalia** can be used if you need more energy or utility, but they're not as optimal for raw Bloom output. **5-star claymores** that boost EM (like a theoretical EM-based 5-star, though none exist currently) would be ideal, but none are better than dedicated 4-stars like Mailed Flower for his role. Kaveh shines brightest in **Bloom-centric teams** with Hydro units. His best partners are **Nilou**, who creates Bountiful Cores that deal massive damage and scale with HP and EM, and **Hydro applicators** like **Barbara**, **Kokomi**, or **Xingqiu**, who keep enemies wet so Kaveh can continuously trigger Blooms. In **Hyperbloom** teams, he can work with Electro characters like **Kuki Shinobu** or **Raiden Shogun**, but he doesn\u2019t trigger Hyperbloom himself\u2014Electro does\u2014so he plays more of a support/Dendro aura role in those setups. Kaveh can also function in **Burgeoise teams** (Burning + Bloom), with Pyro units like **Thoma** adding a bit of damage and crowd control, though this style is more niche. Overall, Kaveh is a stylish and satisfying Bloom enabler who brings something fresh to the Dendro roster. His ability to **trigger and detonate cores actively** sets him apart, and while he may not be as universally meta-defining as Nahida or Alhaitham, he fills a unique role with flair. He scales well with investment, and with the right EM-focused build and Hydro synergy, he becomes a reliable and explosive source of AoE damage that can handle most types of content. For players who enjoy reaction-heavy teams and want a Dendro DPS with a twist, Kaveh is an excellent pick."}, {"question": "Tell me about Stheno", "answer": "Sethos is a 4-star Electro bow user from Sumeru, introduced in *Genshin Impact* Version 4.7. He is a reaction-focused **on-field DPS** who scales primarily with **Elemental Mastery (EM)** and is built to thrive in **Aggravate** and **Hyperbloom** teams. His unique scaling and consistent Electro application make him an excellent choice for players who enjoy reaction-based gameplay with fast-paced ranged combat. Unlike many traditional bow users, Sethos is not about aiming precision or physical hits\u2014his kit is designed around **spamming his Elemental Skill** and leveraging EM to maximize damage through elemental reactions. Sethos\u2019 **Elemental Skill**, *Secret Rite: Twilight Shadowpiercer*, is a charged Electro arrow that pierces through enemies, dealing AoE damage. The ability can be tapped or held, and the damage scales directly with his Elemental Mastery. This means the more EM Sethos has, the more damage his Skill does\u2014both directly and through reactions like Aggravate or Hyperbloom. This also makes him less dependent on traditional ATK or Crit-based builds and more focused on stacking EM for maximum effectiveness. His Skill also generates energy, supporting his rotation and team uptime. His **Elemental Burst**, *The Sand King\u2019s Rite*, summons a field that unleashes multiple waves of Electro damage in a large AoE. The number of waves and the total damage scale with his Elemental Mastery, making it an excellent tool for both burst damage and triggering Electro reactions across a wide field. This Burst has moderate energy cost, and while not his main damage source, it complements his Skill-focused playstyle and increases his consistency in combat. Between his Skill and Burst, Sethos stays active on the field, driving elemental reactions while his teammates apply other elements off-field. Sethos is perfectly viable at **C0**, but his **constellations** significantly improve his performance. **C1** increases the Crit Rate of his Elemental Skill, helping EM-based builds that lack innate Crit scaling to deal more consistent damage. **C2** extends the duration of his Burst and adds more Electro hits, increasing total damage and energy generation. **C4** boosts his EM when triggering reactions, enhancing his scaling even further, and **C6** gives a large flat EM bonus after using his Skill, allowing you to reach high EM thresholds without sacrificing substats for survivability or recharge. His constellations primarily focus on improving uptime, EM scaling, and consistency\u2014making each one a noticeable quality-of-life and damage bump. When building Sethos, **Elemental Mastery** is the most important stat. His **best artifact set** is **4-piece Gilded Dreams**, which increases EM and grants additional ATK or EM based on the elemental composition of the team. This set is ideal because Sethos always triggers reactions and benefits from both EM and the conditional stats Gilded Dreams provides. If Gilded Dreams is unavailable, a mix of **2-piece EM sets** like **Wanderer\u2019s Troupe**, **Flower of Paradise Lost**, or **Instructor** can serve as temporary options. For main stats, prioritize **EM on Sands**, **Electro DMG Bonus on Goblet**, and either **Crit Rate** or **Crit DMG on Circlet** if you\u2019re trying to balance his damage, but in pure EM-focused builds, triple EM works especially well. Substats should aim for EM, Energy Recharge (for Burst uptime), and some Crit if possible. For **weapons**, Sethos works best with bows that provide **Elemental Mastery or support reaction-based gameplay**. His best 4-star choice is **The Stringless**, which increases both Elemental Skill and Burst damage and comes with an EM main stat. **Windblume Ode** (if you have it from events) also provides EM and buffs ATK after Skill use, which synergizes with his kit. **Sacrificial Bow** can be decent if you need more Skill casts for energy, though it\u2019s less ideal for maximizing damage. **Fading Twilight** and **Mouun\u2019s Moon** can work in niche setups but aren\u2019t optimal for his EM scaling. As for 5-star bows, **Hunter\u2019s Path** or **Aqua Simulacra** can be decent if you want to invest heavily, but they lean more toward Crit builds than EM-focused play. Sethos fits naturally into **Aggravate** and **Hyperbloom teams**, where he acts as the Electro trigger while other units apply Dendro or Hydro. In **Aggravate comps**, ideal teammates include **Nahida**, **Baizhu**, or **Dendro Traveler** for off-field Dendro application, and **Fischl**, **Yae Miko**, or **Raiden Shogun** as additional Electro supports. **Zhongli** can also be included for shield protection, allowing Sethos to attack uninterrupted. A strong Aggravate team could be **Sethos + Nahida + Fischl + Zhongli**, focusing on continuous Electro-Dendro synergy with good defensive utility. In **Hyperbloom comps**, Sethos pairs with **Hydro applicators** like **Xingqiu**, **Yelan**, **Kokomi**, or **Barbara** to create Dendro cores via Bloom. Dendro characters like **Collei**, **Yaoyao**, or **Dendro Traveler** generate the cores, and Sethos triggers the Hyperblooms with his fast Electro application. A great Hyperbloom team would be **Sethos + Xingqiu + Collei + Yaoyao**, offering reactions, healing, and consistent core production. Sethos can also slot into **Taser-style teams**, although he's best in Dendro-centric comps. In Taser, he pairs with **Electro + Hydro + Anemo**, enabling Electro-Charged reactions, but this setup may not fully utilize his EM scaling unless supported properly. In summary, Sethos is a flexible, reaction-heavy Electro DPS with a strong emphasis on Elemental Mastery. His fast, charged Skill and wide-area Burst make him perfect for triggering Aggravate and Hyperbloom, and his kit rewards smart rotations and team synergy. With the right setup\u2014EM-focused artifacts, proper energy generation, and reaction-based team support\u2014Sethos becomes a dynamic and satisfying main DPS capable of delivering powerful, elemental attacks that light up the battlefield."}, {"question": "Tell me about Lisa", "answer": "Lisa is a 4-star Electro catalyst user and one of the original characters available in *Genshin Impact*. While she often gets overlooked due to being a free starter unit, Lisa can be built into a strong **Electro support**, **reaction enabler**, or even an **off-field debuffer**, depending on how you build her. Her versatility and **Defense-shredding utility**, especially at higher constellations, make her more valuable than she initially appears\u2014especially in **Aggravate**, **Hyperbloom**, or **Electro-Charged** teams. Lisa\u2019s **Elemental Skill**, *Violet Arc*, has two modes. A quick tap deals AoE Electro damage and applies a stack of Conductive to enemies. Holding the Skill channels a powerful lightning strike that deals more damage the more Conductive stacks an enemy has (up to 3). While the hold version has long animation time and isn\u2019t ideal in fast-paced fights, it deals significant damage if fully charged. However, Lisa\u2019s main strength comes from her **Elemental Burst**, *Lightning Rose*, which summons a large Electro AoE field that deals continuous Electro damage over time and applies Electro status regularly. This makes her an excellent enabler for Electro-related elemental reactions, especially **Aggravate** and **Electro-Charged**. Her **passive talents** also provide meaningful utility. *Static Electricity Field* reduces enemy DEF by 15% when they are hit by a fully charged Violet Arc, making her one of the few 4-star characters who can **shred enemy defense**, which benefits every character on your team. This is especially helpful for boss fights and against high-HP enemies. Her other passive, *General Pharmaceutics*, increases potion crafting efficiency\u2014less useful in combat, but still a nice bonus. Lisa\u2019s **constellations** improve her consistency and support role. **C1** increases Energy gained when hitting enemies affected by Electro with her Burst, helping recharge her Burst more quickly. **C2** extends her Burst duration, increasing total damage and uptime. **C4** makes enemies hit by her Burst have reduced DEF by 15%, even if you didn\u2019t fully charge her Skill\u2014this turns her into a very accessible **DEF shred support**. **C6** is her strongest constellation, giving a huge **25% Electro DMG bonus** to characters within her Burst field, making her a fantastic support for other Electro carries like Raiden Shogun, Cyno, or Keqing. While Lisa is serviceable at C0, she really begins to shine around **C4** and becomes a full-fledged support powerhouse at **C6**. When it comes to **artifacts**, Lisa has a few strong options depending on her role. For **support and reaction builds**, **4-piece Noblesse Oblige** is a great choice, boosting her team\u2019s ATK after casting her Burst and increasing its damage. If another character is already using Noblesse, you can use **4-piece Thundering Fury** for better Electro reaction damage and reduced Skill cooldown. If you're focusing on Aggravate teams, **2-piece Thundering Fury + 2-piece Gilded Dreams** or **EM + EM** is great for boosting reaction damage. Main stats should be **Energy Recharge or Elemental Mastery on Sands**, **Electro DMG Bonus on Goblet**, and **Crit Rate or Crit DMG on Circlet**, or **EM Circlet** if she\u2019s being reaction-focused. Substats should prioritize ER, EM, and Crit. Lisa benefits greatly from **Energy Recharge and EM-scaling weapons**. Her best free-to-play option is **Hakushin Ring**, a craftable catalyst that gives Energy Recharge and buffs Electro DMG for your party after triggering Electro reactions\u2014perfect for support Lisa. **Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers** is also strong for buffing your main DPS with a 48% ATK boost after swapping. For more offensive builds, **The Widsith** is a top-tier 4-star option, offering huge stat boosts in rotation. **Favonius Codex** can also be used for Energy generation if your team is Burst-heavy. At the 5-star level, **Kagura\u2019s Verity** and **Skyward Atlas** provide big damage, though they\u2019re overkill for her support role and better reserved for DPS-focused builds. In terms of **team comps**, Lisa works best in **Aggravate** and **Electro-Charged** teams. In **Aggravate**, she pairs well with **Dendro units** like **Nahida**, **Collei**, or **Dendro Traveler**, and **Electro units** like **Fischl**, **Yae Miko**, or **Raiden Shogun**. Lisa can act as the Burst support, applying Electro and reducing enemy DEF, allowing the rest of the team to hit harder. In **Electro-Charged** teams, she synergizes with **Hydro characters** like **Xingqiu**, **Yelan**, or **Kokomi**, triggering constant reactions and amplifying damage. In **Hyperbloom** teams, Lisa can trigger Dendro cores using Electro, though she competes with faster Electro appliers like Kuki Shinobu or Raiden. However, she still works well, especially when paired with **EM-based builds**. Lisa can also serve in **monotype Electro comps** or **burst support comps**, especially when you need a reliable DEF shredder who doesn\u2019t take up much field time. Her **DEF debuff and Electro application** make her a natural support for **Raiden Shogun**, **Keqing**, or **Cyno**, especially when she holds Thrilling Tales or Noblesse. With the right setup, Lisa can push these units to new damage thresholds without requiring much investment herself. In summary, Lisa is an underrated but incredibly flexible Electro support who excels at **burst damage, reaction setups, and team-wide utility**. While she\u2019s often sidelined as a starter unit, players who invest in her will find a capable and surprisingly potent character with strong team value. Whether you build her for **Electro reaction damage**, **burst support**, or **DEF shred utility**, Lisa brings consistent Electro application, good AoE damage, and valuable buffs to any team that needs a little extra spark."}, {"question": "Tell me about Fischl", "answer": "Fischl is a 4-star Electro bow user in *Genshin Impact* who excels as a **top-tier off-field Electro DPS and reaction enabler**. Her ability to deal consistent Electro damage through her raven companion **Oz** makes her one of the most flexible and powerful 4-star characters in the game. Fischl thrives in **Aggravate**, **Electro-Charged**, **Overload**, and **Physical** damage teams, thanks to her persistent Electro application, fast cooldowns, and compatibility with nearly every element. Whether you're a new player looking for easy damage or an endgame player optimizing Abyss clears, Fischl can fit into just about any team with minimal investment. Fischl\u2019s **Elemental Skill**, *Nightrider*, summons Oz, her electro raven, who continuously deals Electro damage to nearby enemies. Oz stays on the field for a significant duration and continues attacking even when Fischl is off-field, making her ideal for enabling **Elemental Reactions** with other characters. The Skill has a short cooldown, and Oz can be repositioned by casting the Skill again once its cooldown resets. Fischl\u2019s **Elemental Burst**, *Midnight Phantasmagoria*, causes her to transform into Oz, fly across enemies dealing AoE Electro damage, and then resummon Oz. It\u2019s best used as a quick burst reset for Oz, not as a primary damage source. Fischl\u2019s **passive talents** enhance her supportive damage role. Her second passive, *Undone Be Thy Sinful Hex*, makes Oz strike enemies alongside the active character\u2019s Normal Attacks whenever Oz is on the field, further increasing Electro uptime and damage. This mechanic works incredibly well with characters like Yoimiya, Wanderer, or Ayato, whose quick Normal Attack strings allow for repeated Electro procs. Fischl is extremely strong even at **C0**, but her **constellations** make her even more efficient and deadly. **C1** increases Oz\u2019s summoning duration, improving her uptime. **C2** allows Oz to deal extra Electro damage when reactions occur (like Electro-Charged or Superconduct), which significantly boosts her reaction DPS. **C3** raises her Skill level, while **C4** restores energy when Oz hits enemies\u2014a huge help for Burst-reliant teams. **C6** is where Fischl hits her peak: when the active character triggers an Electro-related reaction, Oz summons a powerful Electro strike, adding an extra layer of damage with minimal effort. This constellation makes her one of the strongest 4-star off-field DPS units in the game. Fischl\u2019s best artifact set depends on her role. If you\u2019re focusing on **Aggravate or Electro reaction damage**, **4-piece Thundering Fury** is ideal\u2014it boosts Electro DMG and reduces Skill cooldown, allowing more frequent Oz summons. If she\u2019s in a **reaction-heavy** team like Taser or Hyperbloom, **2-piece Thundering Fury + 2-piece Gilded Dreams** or **EM-focused sets** work well. For **physical DPS Fischl**, **4-piece Pale Flame** or **Bloodstained Chivalry** is better, especially if she\u2019s on-field. For support Fischl, **2-piece ATK% + 2-piece Electro DMG Bonus** is a solid fallback. Her stat priorities include **ATK% or EM on Sands**, **Electro DMG Bonus on Goblet**, and **Crit Rate or Crit DMG on Circlet**, depending on weapon and build. For reaction-based Fischl, EM Sands and Circlet are viable as well. In terms of **weapons**, Fischl has many great options. **The Stringless** is arguably her best 4-star weapon, boosting both her Skill and Burst damage while providing EM, perfect for reaction-based builds. **Alley Hunter** is another strong pick for pure DMG, increasing damage while off-field. **Mitternachts Waltz** works well for hybrid Physical/Electro builds. For F2P players, **Slingshot** and **Compound Bow** can serve as early options, though they\u2019re not ideal long-term. If you have 5-star bows, **Elegy for the End** provides EM and team support, and **Skyward Harp** or **Aqua Simulacra** push her Crit-based DPS even further. Fischl fits into a wide variety of teams. In **Aggravate** teams, she pairs perfectly with **Dendro units** like **Nahida**, **Dendro Traveler**, or **Collei**, alongside an Anemo support like Sucrose or Kazuha to spread Electro and reduce resistance. In **Electro-Charged (Taser)** teams, she works well with **Xingqiu**, **Beidou**, and an Anemo unit for grouping. In **Hyperbloom** teams, she can act as the Electro trigger, working with **Hydro** and **Dendro** units to detonate Bloom cores. Fischl also shines in **mono-Electro teams** with **Raiden**, **Yae Miko**, or **Lisa**, contributing constant damage and energy. She even works in **Physical DPS comps**, where she supports a character like **Eula** by applying Superconduct to reduce Physical resistance. In summary, Fischl is one of the best 4-star units in *Genshin Impact* thanks to her constant Electro application, strong reaction potential, and incredible versatility. She fits into nearly every team, scales well with investment, and becomes a monster at C6. Whether you use her in Aggravate, Taser, Hyperbloom, or Physical comps, Fischl provides massive value for very little field time. With the right artifacts, weapon, and teammates, Fischl can carry reaction damage output and enable some of the most efficient teams in the game."}, {"question": "Tell me about Yae miko", "answer": "Yae Miko is a 5-star Electro catalyst user who serves as a **high-impact off-field sub-DPS** and **burst nuker**. Her elegant but deadly playstyle revolves around placing her **Sesshou Sakura totems** to deal consistent off-field Electro damage, while using her **Elemental Burst** to unleash devastating AoE strikes. Yae is especially powerful in **Aggravate**, **Hyperbloom**, and **mono-Electro** teams, where she leverages her scaling and Electro application to trigger reactions or boost the team\u2019s DPS. Her **Elemental Skill**, *Yakan Evocation: Sesshou Sakura*, is her signature ability. It allows her to place up to three Sakura totems on the battlefield, each dealing **periodic Electro damage** to nearby enemies. These totems link to each other and deal increased damage the more are active at once. Importantly, they remain on the field even after Yae is swapped out, making her an excellent off-field Electro applicator. She can also reposition the totems by casting the skill again. The cooldown for each cast is minimal, but placing all three in quick succession and learning proper placement is key to maximizing damage uptime. Her **Elemental Burst**, *Great Secret Art: Tenko Kenshin*, consumes all active totems and turns each into a powerful AoE lightning strike, with additional damage scaling depending on how many Sakura were consumed. This Burst has a high **Energy cost (90)** but delivers enormous Electro burst damage, especially when all three Sakura are active. Because of this, managing energy and Skill uptime is critical to maximizing her effectiveness. Yae\u2019s **constellations** provide substantial improvements to her flow and output. She is strong at **C0**, but her **C1** is a valuable quality-of-life boost, allowing one extra Sesshou Sakura on the field (total of four instead of three), significantly increasing both sustained and burst damage. **C2** increases Sakura attack levels and improves scaling. **C4** regenerates energy after Burst use, helping with her expensive Burst cost. **C6** is a massive power spike\u2014it converts a portion of her EM into bonus Electro damage, making reaction builds like Aggravate or Hyperbloom far more viable and amplifying both her Skill and Burst output. Her constellations make her one of the rare characters whose damage scales both with ATK and, later, EM, depending on build. When it comes to **artifacts**, Yae has a few strong options. For most builds, her **best-in-slot is 4-piece Gilded Dreams** in Aggravate comps, providing a massive EM and ATK boost depending on team setup, and synergizing with her EM-scaling at C6 or in reaction-focused playstyles. For pure Electro damage or mono-Electro teams, **2-piece Thundering Fury + 2-piece ATK%** (such as Gladiator\u2019s or Shimenawa\u2019s) is a strong hybrid option. If no one on your team is holding Noblesse Oblige, you can also equip **4-piece Noblesse** for a teamwide ATK buff. Main stats should be **ATK% or EM Sands**, **Electro DMG Bonus Goblet**, and **Crit Rate or Crit DMG Circlet**, depending on your weapon. Substats should focus on Crit, ATK%, and Energy Recharge (you want at least ~140\u2013160% ER unless Raiden is in your team). For **weapons**, Yae has excellent choices in both 5-star and 4-star categories. Her best-in-slot is her signature weapon, **Kagura\u2019s Verity**, which gives high Crit DMG and boosts her Skill damage significantly as she cycles through her three totems. **Skyward Atlas** is also a great choice for pure damage and ATK scaling. For 4-star options, **The Widsith** is extremely strong due to its rotating buffs\u2014especially at higher refinements\u2014and works well in short fights or Burst-focused rotations. **Solar Pearl** is another solid choice, boosting Skill and Burst damage and offering Crit Rate. If you\u2019re free-to-play, **Hakushin Ring** provides team buffs when triggering Electro reactions and gives Energy Recharge, making it a great utility weapon in Aggravate/Hyperbloom setups. Yae Miko fits naturally into **Aggravate** teams, where her frequent Electro ticks from Sesshou Sakura make her perfect for reacting with Dendro application from characters like **Nahida**, **Dendro Traveler**, or **Collei**. Pairing her with **Raiden Shogun** not only allows for **energy batterying**, but also creates powerful mono-Electro comps that are both sustainable and destructive. In **Hyperbloom teams**, she can act as the Electro trigger for Bloom cores when paired with Hydro and Dendro units like **Xingqiu** and **Yaoyao**. In **Taser teams**, she functions alongside **Fischl**, **Sucrose**, and **Xingqiu**, delivering consistent Electro-Charged damage. A typical high-performing Yae comp might be **Yae Miko + Nahida + Fischl + Zhongli**, where she provides off-field damage and Aggravate triggers, Fischl boosts energy and adds even more Electro, Nahida applies constant Dendro for reactions, and Zhongli keeps her protected while reducing enemy resistance. In a more energy-focused comp, **Yae + Raiden + Bennett + Kazuha** becomes a devastating mono-Electro burst team, with buffs and fast energy cycling enabling full uptime on both characters\u2019 Bursts. In conclusion, Yae Miko is a high-scaling Electro sub-DPS who delivers incredible off-field damage through her totems and devastating burst potential with her Elemental Burst. She excels in reaction-based teams and synergizes well with both Electro and Dendro units. While she has a steep energy cost and can feel clunky at low investment, with proper artifacts, team support, and constellations, Yae becomes one of the most lethal Electro damage dealers in the game\u2014beautiful, elegant, and absolutely deadly."}, {"question": "Tell me about Kuki shinobu", "answer": "Kuki Shinobu is a 4-star Electro sword user introduced in *Genshin Impact* Version 2.7. While she initially flew under the radar, she quickly became one of the **most valuable and flexible 4-star supports**, particularly in **Dendro reaction teams** like **Hyperbloom** and **Aggravate**. Kuki is unique because she brings **consistent off-field Electro application**, **healing**, and **Elemental Mastery scaling**, all in one slot. This makes her incredibly efficient for teams that need sustain and reliable reaction triggers\u2014especially those focused on Bloom-based mechanics. Kuki\u2019s **Elemental Skill**, *Sanctifying Ring*, sacrifices a portion of her HP to create a ring of Electro energy that follows the active character and deals periodic Electro damage to nearby enemies. This ring lasts for 12 seconds and heals the active character every 1.5 seconds based on Kuki\u2019s Max HP. This ability is the **core of her kit**: it scales with both **HP for healing** and **Elemental Mastery for reaction damage**, allowing her to fill both defensive and offensive roles depending on the team. Her **Elemental Burst**, *Gyoei Narukami Kariyama Rite*, is a large AoE strike that deals Electro damage based on her **Max HP**, and while it looks flashy, it's not her primary source of damage\u2014it's more useful for applying Electro quickly in a pinch or dealing burst AoE in reaction-heavy scenarios. One of Kuki's major strengths is how **well she fits into Dendro-focused reaction teams**, especially **Hyperbloom**. In these teams, Dendro and Hydro characters create Bloom seeds (Dendro cores), and Kuki\u2019s periodic Electro ring from her Skill **triggers Hyperbloom**, launching those seeds as homing projectiles for massive damage. This interaction scales entirely with **Elemental Mastery**, not ATK or Crit, so her build focuses purely on EM and HP\u2014making her easy to build and very effective, even with minimal investment. Kuki\u2019s **constellations** further improve her utility. She\u2019s completely viable at **C0**, but her **C2** increases her Skill duration and boosts healing when she\u2019s below 50% HP, which synergizes with her HP-draining mechanic. **C4** reduces enemies' DEF by 15% for 10 seconds after her Burst hits, adding useful team-wide DPS support. **C6** is a significant boost in Hyperbloom or Aggravate teams, as it increases the frequency of her Skill's Electro damage ticks when nearby enemies are below 50% HP, greatly enhancing her reaction potential. While not required, her constellations make her smoother and stronger in every role she plays. For **artifacts**, Kuki\u2019s best-in-slot set in reaction-focused teams is **4-piece Flower of Paradise Lost**. This set boosts Bloom, Hyperbloom, and Burgeon damage, and increases EM significantly\u2014perfect for maximizing her role as a Hyperbloom trigger. If you don\u2019t have this set, **4-piece Gilded Dreams** is a strong alternative, providing an EM bonus and additional buffs based on team composition. You can also use **2-piece EM + 2-piece EM** (Wanderer\u2019s, Gilded, or Paradise) for a solid budget build. Her stat priorities are simple: **Elemental Mastery on Sands, Goblet, and Circlet**. If you want to focus more on healing, **HP% on Sands** and **Healing Bonus** on Circlet are options, but for Hyperbloom or Aggravate damage, full EM is best. Substats should prioritize EM and Energy Recharge. Kuki\u2019s **best weapons** in reaction comps are **EM-based swords**. **Iron Sting** (craftable) is a top choice, offering EM and an Elemental DMG bonus after triggering reactions. **Xiphos\u2019 Moonlight** is another excellent option, giving EM and scaling Energy Recharge based on EM. **Freedom-Sworn** is a high-end 5-star option that buffs the entire team while boosting EM, making it great if you already have one. **Sacrificial Sword** is useful if you want more uptime or emergency Skill resets, though it\u2019s less ideal for damage. Avoid Crit- or ATK-based swords unless you\u2019re building her purely for healing. Kuki fits naturally into **Hyperbloom teams**, often with characters like **Dendro Traveler**, **Nahida**, **Yaoyao**, **Xingqiu**, or **Yelan**. A typical Hyperbloom team might look like **Kuki + Nahida + Xingqiu + Collei**, where Dendro and Hydro apply elements to create Dendro cores and Kuki triggers Hyperblooms every few seconds with her Electro ring. In **Aggravate teams**, she works well with **Fischl**, **Raiden**, **Nahida**, or **Yae Miko**, serving as both a secondary Electro source and team healer. She can also contribute to **Taser comps** (Electro-Charged), particularly with **Sangonomiya Kokomi** or **Barbara**, offering healing and reaction support simultaneously. In summary, Kuki Shinobu is one of the most **efficient and flexible 4-star characters** in the game. She heals, applies Electro consistently, and triggers some of the strongest elemental reactions in the current meta. Her **HP-drain mechanic** and **EM-scaling kit** let her shine in both supportive and offensive roles, depending on your team\u2019s needs. Whether you're running **Hyperbloom**, **Aggravate**, or just want a reliable off-field Electro healer, Kuki delivers consistent value in one compact, stylish package."}, {"question": "Tell me about Mika", "answer": "Mika is a 4-star Cryo polearm user in *Genshin Impact*, introduced in Version 3.5. He serves as a **dedicated support for Physical damage teams**, offering a rare combination of **Attack Speed buffs, Physical DMG bonuses**, and **healing**. Mika was designed with characters like **Eula** in mind, helping them reach higher damage ceilings by boosting their physical output and keeping them sustained. While his use cases are somewhat niche, Mika performs exceptionally well within his intended role and can become a valuable part of specific team compositions. Mika\u2019s **Elemental Skill**, *Starfrost Swirl*, launches a crossbow bolt that deals Cryo damage and grants nearby characters the **Soulwind** buff. This buff increases **Attack Speed**, which is particularly helpful for characters who rely on Normal or Charged Attacks to build or unleash damage. The Skill also provides energy particles and contributes to Cryo application, although it\u2019s not his main focus. This Attack Speed buff is especially potent when paired with Physical DPS characters, helping them squeeze in more attacks during their burst windows or before rotation ends. His **Elemental Burst**, *Skyfeather Song*, heals all nearby party members and provides the **Eagleplume** effect to active characters. This effect causes healing over time when Normal Attacks hit enemies, with healing scaling from Mika\u2019s **Max HP**. At the same time, the burst grants a **Physical DMG bonus** through Mika\u2019s Talent, which stacks as his teammates hit enemies with Normal Attacks. The Physical DMG buff has a cap that can increase with constellations. This makes Mika a **hybrid support**, capable of both boosting Physical damage and providing sustained healing, all while staying off-field. Mika is usable at **C0**, but many of his best features are unlocked through his **constellations**. **C1** allows him to generate more energy when his Skill hits multiple enemies, helping to sustain his Burst. **C2** increases the duration of his Skill's Attack Speed buff, improving uptime. **C4** adds a **flat Physical Crit DMG bonus** to the Eagleplume effect, significantly improving damage for characters like Eula, Razor, or Freminet. **C6** is his most important power spike\u2014it increases the maximum stacks of the Physical DMG bonus and allows it to scale further with the active character\u2019s Attack Speed. This constellation turns Mika into a **top-tier enabler** for Physical DPS characters, letting them reach their full potential. When it comes to **artifacts**, Mika\u2019s best set depends on whether you\u2019re focusing on his **healing**, **supporting**, or balancing both. For general use, **4-piece Noblesse Oblige** is excellent, allowing him to buff team ATK when using his Burst. If healing is your priority, **2-piece Tenacity of the Millelith + 2-piece HP%** works well to enhance both his healing and survivability. If you want a mix of healing and support, you can also run **2-piece Noblesse + 2-piece HP% or Energy Recharge**. Main stats should be **HP% Sands**, **HP% Goblet**, and **Healing Bonus or HP% Circlet**. Substats should focus on **Energy Recharge (to maintain Burst uptime)**, **HP%**, and **flat HP**. In terms of **weapons**, Mika does best with **Energy Recharge or HP-scaling polearms**. **Favonius Lance** is arguably his best 4-star option, generating particles for the team and maintaining Burst uptime. **The Black Tassel** is a great budget weapon with HP% and is surprisingly effective if you only care about healing. **Prototype Starglitter** (crafted) provides ER and can work as a F2P choice. **Engulfing Lightning** is a 5-star luxury option, though it's usually better used on more offensive characters. Mika doesn\u2019t need Crit or ATK weapons, so it\u2019s best to avoid anything with those stats unless you\u2019re running a meme on-field build. Mika excels in **Physical damage teams**, where his buffs directly benefit main DPS characters who rely on Normal or Charged Attacks. His best synergy is with **Eula**, providing healing, Attack Speed, and a stacking Physical DMG bonus that all help her build and unleash her Elemental Burst more effectively. **Razor** also benefits significantly from Mika\u2019s buffs, especially at lower Adventure Ranks. **Freminet**, another Physical DPS, can take advantage of Mika\u2019s speed boost and healing to stay on-field longer. Mika also works with **Diona** in Cryo resonance teams to boost Crit Rate and provide additional shielding. While Mika doesn\u2019t fit well in **reaction-focused teams** like Freeze or Melt (since he applies minimal Cryo and doesn\u2019t scale with EM), he\u2019s one of the **best Physical buffers** in the game. His presence in a team built around Physical damage is almost essential, as few other characters offer the same combination of **healing, Attack Speed, and Physical DMG support** in one role. His ease of use, low field time, and good scaling make him very comfortable to play. In summary, Mika is a **specialist support unit** who excels at enhancing Physical DPS characters with healing and powerful buffs. His kit is well-designed for longer fights, sustained on-field damage, and Physical-heavy compositions. If you\u2019re running Eula, Razor, or Freminet, Mika is a **must-have teammate** who brings consistency, survivability, and performance boosts\u2014making him an excellent addition to any roster built around Physical carry gameplay."}, {"question": "Tell me about Kirara", "answer": "Kirara is a 4-star **Dendro sword** user from Inazuma, introduced in *Genshin Impact* Version 3.7. As a cheerful and dependable delivery expert for the Komaniya Express, she brings more than just packages\u2014she offers strong **shielding**, solid **Dendro application**, and even surprising **mobility** through her unique sprint-like Skill. Kirara is a **support/tank-style unit** who works especially well in **Dendro reaction teams**, offering both defensive utility and elemental setup for Bloom, Hyperbloom, or Quicken-based reactions. Kirara\u2019s **Elemental Skill**, *Meow-teor Kick*, has two modes. A **tap** creates a shield and launches a flying kick that deals Dendro damage. A **hold** transforms her into a **delivery box-clad \u201cUrgent Neko Parcel\u201d form**, allowing her to run around at high speed while dealing collision-based Dendro damage and generating a stronger shield upon exit. The shield scales with her **Max HP**, and the longer she remains in her transformed state, the stronger the final shield becomes. This Skill is her core feature\u2014it offers strong **front-loaded shielding**, **mobility**, and **multi-target Dendro application**, making her especially useful in Bloom and Burgeon teams where safe Dendro uptime is crucial. Her **Elemental Burst**, *Secret Art: Surprise Dispatch*, deals AoE Dendro damage by throwing explosive claws that split and hit multiple enemies. It has a low energy cost and short animation time, making it easy to weave into rotations. While the Burst isn\u2019t her primary source of damage, it helps maintain **Dendro aura**, especially in reaction-focused teams. Because both her Skill and Burst apply Dendro reliably, she can act as a **Dendro applier and enabler** in teams that require frequent elemental interactions. Kirara\u2019s **passives** make her even more comfortable to use. One of her talents increases shield strength further when she's below half HP or has two enemies nearby, which helps with survivability in tougher content. Another passive boosts her movement speed and climbing stamina use when she\u2019s in party, adding some quality-of-life for exploration. Kirara is usable at **C0**, but her **constellations** enhance her support capability. **C1** makes her shield better at absorbing damage by increasing its duration and damage absorption. **C2** improves her Dendro application by releasing extra Dendro bombs when her shielded character triggers Bloom, Burgeon, or Hyperbloom reactions\u2014turning her into a minor offensive enabler. **C4** restores energy based on her Max HP, helping with Burst uptime. **C6** boosts her Elemental Mastery whenever a shielded character triggers a Dendro core-related reaction, enhancing her synergy with Bloom-focused teams. These constellations gradually push Kirara from a purely defensive unit into a more **reaction-oriented support** with both offensive and defensive tools. For **artifacts**, Kirara\u2019s build depends on her role. For pure shielding and survivability, **4-piece Tenacity of the Millelith** is ideal\u2014it increases shield strength and buffs team ATK when her Skill hits enemies. If another unit is already using Tenacity, **2-piece HP% + 2-piece HP%**, or a combination with **Emblem of Severed Fate** for ER can work. If you're running her in **Hyperbloom or Burgeon teams**, where her Dendro application plays a more active role, **4-piece Deepwood Memories** is excellent for reducing Dendro resistance of enemies and boosting reaction damage. For main stats, use **HP% on Sands**, **HP% on Goblet**, and **HP% or Healing Bonus on Circlet** for shield support. In reaction teams, you can swap to **EM Sands** or **EM Circlet** if her main task is to trigger Bloom or apply Dendro. Her best **weapons** vary by build. For a shield-support focus, **Favonius Sword** is excellent\u2014it provides Energy Recharge and helps battery the team. **Sacrificial Sword** is also great if you want to reset her Skill cooldown and refresh shields faster. For pure HP-based scaling, **Freedom-Sworn** or **Key of Khaj-Nisut** (5-stars) offer buffs and high HP stats but are overkill unless you\u2019re building a high-investment team. For reaction-focused builds, **Iron Sting** gives EM and boosts elemental damage after triggering a reaction, making it a strong choice in Hyperbloom or Quicken teams. Kirara fits well into **Bloom, Burgeon, and Hyperbloom teams**, where her **frequent Dendro application** and strong **shielding** provide both offensive setup and defensive safety. In **Hyperbloom**, she can pair with **Hydro applicators** like Xingqiu, Yelan, or Kokomi and Electro triggers like Kuki Shinobu. In **Burgeon**, she works with Pyro off-field units like Thoma or Xiangling while shielding the team and applying Dendro. She can also function in **Quicken/Aggravate** setups with units like Fischl or Raiden, where her Dendro uptime keeps the aura going for Aggravate reactions. While she\u2019s not as offensively oriented as Nahida or Alhaitham, she brings a **tankier and safer alternative** to fragile Dendro units\u2014perfect for newer players or Abyss comps that need survivability without sacrificing elemental setup. In conclusion, Kirara is a highly functional and flexible **Dendro support** who combines **strong defensive utility, movement, and reliable Dendro application**. She might not be a reaction powerhouse herself, but she supports the rest of your team in triggering reactions consistently and safely. Whether you\u2019re shielding Bloom teams, enabling Hyperbloom, or offering support to fragile carries, Kirara delivers dependable performance with a fun, energetic playstyle\u2014plus, she\u2019s great at climbing walls."}, {"question": "Tell me about Chiori", "answer": "Chiori is a 5-star **Geo sword user** introduced in *Genshin Impact* Version 4.5. Hailing from Inazuma and serving as the famed fashion designer behind Fontaine\u2019s Court of Fontaine styles, Chiori is a **main DPS or sub-DPS** who excels in **Geo-centric teams**, leveraging her unique puppet-based kit to deal **scaling off-field Geo damage**. What makes her stand out is her synergy with **Construct-based characters** like Albedo, Zhongli, and the Geo Traveler, making her a **perfect fit for mono Geo teams** or any lineup looking to take advantage of **off-field Geo constructs and resonance**. Chiori\u2019s **Elemental Skill**, *Fluttering Hasode*, summons a **Geo construct puppet**\u2014a Tapestry Troupe puppet\u2014that deals AoE Geo damage upon summoning and periodically deals more Geo damage over time. The puppet\u2019s damage scales off **Chiori\u2019s ATK and DEF**, making her **dual-scaling**, which gives you flexibility in builds. If there\u2019s another **Geo Construct** on the field (like Albedo\u2019s flower or Zhongli\u2019s pillar), Chiori will summon an additional puppet, doubling her off-field damage output. This synergy makes her amazing in teams that already use Construct-creating characters. The puppets persist even if Chiori leaves the field, allowing her to act as either an **on-field Geo DPS** or a powerful **off-field sub-DPS**. Her **Elemental Burst**, *Hiyoku: Twin Blades*, deals a quick flurry of slashes in a straight line, followed by a powerful AoE Geo explosion. It has a relatively low energy cost (60), and while it\u2019s not the core of her damage like her Skill, it\u2019s a strong burst option for clearing waves and maintaining Geo application. The Burst also benefits from both ATK and DEF, encouraging a dual-scaling artifact setup for maximum output. Chiori\u2019s **passive talents** complement her playstyle perfectly. One passive increases her **CRIT Rate** by 20% when your party has two Geo characters, which is extremely easy to fulfill in mono Geo teams. Another passive boosts her **ATK based on her DEF**, reinforcing the idea of a hybrid build that makes use of both stats. This makes building her incredibly rewarding, as it allows you to stack DEF% and still benefit offensively from it. Her **constellations** enhance her kit naturally but aren\u2019t required for her to shine. **C1** boosts her Burst damage and restores energy when hitting multiple enemies, helping with uptime. **C2** increases puppet duration, which improves her off-field damage output over time. **C4** increases the puppet\u2019s damage against enemies under crowd control or shields, synergizing well with Zhongli. **C6** is a huge spike\u2014it increases her Geo damage bonus by 20% when casting her Skill and allows her to create **a third puppet** if two Geo Constructs are already on the field. This gives her an unprecedented level of sustained, off-field Geo damage and makes her one of the **strongest Geo enablers** in the game. For **artifacts**, Chiori\u2019s best-in-slot is **4-piece Husk of Opulent Dreams**, which gives DEF% and a stacking Geo DMG Bonus, both of which scale with her dual ATK/DEF mechanic. You can also use **2-piece Archaic Petra + 2-piece Husk** or **2-piece ATK% + 2-piece DEF%** as early-game options. Her stat priorities should focus on **DEF% or ATK% Sands** (depending on which stat is higher in your weapon), **Geo DMG Bonus Goblet**, and **Crit Rate or Crit DMG Circlet**. For substats, aim for a mix of **Crit Rate, Crit DMG, DEF%, and ATK%**\u2014Energy Recharge can be useful but isn\u2019t a major focus due to her low Burst cost and frequent Skill usage. Chiori has several excellent **weapon options**, thanks to her dual scaling. Her signature weapon, **Uraku Misugiri**, is her best-in-slot\u2014it provides Crit DMG and boosts Skill damage significantly, especially when hitting multiple enemies. For 5-star alternatives, **Primordial Jade Cutter** gives high Crit Rate and ATK, and **Mistsplitter Reforged** also boosts her normal and Elemental DMG. In the 4-star category, **The Black Sword** is a strong choice for Crit Rate and healing, while **Lion\u2019s Roar** can be used against enemies affected by Electro or Pyro, though it\u2019s situational. **Harbinger of Dawn** is an excellent F2P option if you can keep her HP above 90%. Chiori performs best in **mono Geo teams**, where she can benefit from **Geo resonance** and summon multiple puppets thanks to the presence of other constructs. Her best teammates include **Albedo**, **Zhongli**, **Geo Traveler**, and **Gorou**. Albedo provides off-field Geo damage and an extra construct, Zhongli brings shields and resistance shred, and Gorou buffs DEF and Geo DMG, amplifying Chiori\u2019s performance. A strong mono Geo team might include **Chiori + Albedo + Zhongli + Gorou**, offering synergy, resonance, and sustained off-field damage. She can also be flexed into **Geo-Hypercarry comps**, where she acts as the main DPS with non-Geo support characters. For example, pairing her with **Bennett** and **Kazuha** allows her to receive external buffs while still maintaining puppet uptime, though you\u2019ll lose the second puppet without another Geo unit. In summary, **Chiori is a highly flexible Geo DPS** who can be played on-field or off-field, and who scales with both ATK and DEF for versatile building. Her puppet mechanics make her unique among sword users, and she excels in **Geo construct-based teams**. Whether you\u2019re building a mono Geo team or want a fashionable, high-damage sub-DPS, Chiori brings both style and substance\u2014with some of the most elegant and efficient off-field damage in the Geo element."}, {"question": "Tell me about arlecchino", "answer": "Arlecchino is a 5-star **Pyro polearm user** and the first playable Harbinger in *Genshin Impact*, introduced in **Version 4.6**. As the **Fourth of the Fatui Harbingers**, she brings a ruthless, aggressive, and high-risk high-reward playstyle that makes her a **Hypercarry main DPS**. Her kit revolves around **HP management**, **Bond of Life mechanics**, and powerful **Pyro-infused attacks** that allow her to dominate the battlefield with relentless damage. Arlecchino is unique in that she **cannot be healed normally** during combat\u2014instead, her damage and survivability are tied to how she manages **Bond of Life**, a mechanic that replaces traditional healing with strategic self-recovery. Arlecchino\u2019s **Elemental Skill**, *All is Ash*, is the core of her combat loop. It marks enemies with a **Blood-Debt Directive**, and when she hits marked enemies, she absorbs those marks to gain a portion of **Bond of Life**\u2014a red HP overlay that locks part of her HP pool. The more Bond of Life she has, the **stronger her damage becomes**, and when she absorbs these marks, her Normal Attacks become **Pyro-infused** for 20 seconds. During this state, Arlecchino's attacks scale significantly, turning her into a **field-dominating Pyro DPS**. This also enables her to stay on the field for long periods, as the marks and her attack chains are her main source of recovery. Her **Elemental Burst**, *Balemoon Rising*, is a hard-hitting Pyro AoE slash that **clears all her Bond of Life** and deals more damage based on how much Bond of Life was consumed. It also **heals her** for the Bond of Life removed, making it a rare and strategic way to reset her HP and prep for the next rotation. Because she cannot be healed by external healing abilities while in combat, this Burst is crucial for maintaining her uptime and avoiding getting locked out of her kit due to low HP. This dynamic gives Arlecchino a powerful but risky feel, where smart timing and mark management are critical to staying alive and maximizing DPS. Arlecchino\u2019s **constellations** elevate her performance dramatically, though she is already **exceptional at C0**. **C1** reduces her stamina consumption and gives Crit Rate against marked enemies, smoothing out her damage. **C2** increases the duration of her Skill\u2019s infusion and improves energy generation. **C4** boosts her Burst\u2019s damage and its healing conversion, making her Bond of Life-clearing Burst even stronger. **C6** is a huge spike\u2014it allows her Skill to grant **additional Crit DMG and Pyro DMG Bonus** when consuming multiple marks, transforming her into a devastating nuker with near-unmatched scaling. While not necessary, these constellations make her smoother, more explosive, and more forgiving in longer fights. For **artifacts**, Arlecchino\u2019s best-in-slot set is the **4-piece Fragment of Harmonic Whimsy**, which is **tailor-made for her**. It boosts ATK when gaining Bond of Life and further increases damage when Bond is cleared or reduced\u2014both of which happen constantly in her rotation. Alternatives include **2-piece Crimson Witch of Flames + 2-piece ATK%**, or even **4-piece Gladiator\u2019s Finale**, though these are significantly weaker than her signature set. As for main stats, go for **ATK% or HP% Sands** (depending on your weapon and how you balance stats), **Pyro DMG Bonus on Goblet**, and **Crit Rate or Crit DMG Circlet**, adjusted based on your weapon and Crit ratio. Substats should focus on **Crit Rate, Crit DMG, ATK%, and some Energy Recharge** (around 120\u2013130% ER is generally sufficient). Arlecchino\u2019s **best weapon** is her **signature polearm**, *Crimson Moon\u2019s Semblance*, which increases ATK and Crit DMG when she gains or consumes Bond of Life\u2014perfectly synergizing with her entire kit. Other strong 5-star options include **Staff of Homa** (thanks to its HP scaling and Crit DMG bonus), **Primordial Jade Winged-Spear**, and **Engulfing Lightning** (if you need ER). For 4-star options, **Deathmatch** is great for Crit Rate and general ATK buffing, and **Blackcliff Pole** can be a decent Crit DMG alternative. **The Catch** is not ideal since she doesn't rely heavily on her Burst damage output. Arlecchino works best as a **solo carry** in teams that **buff her, battery her, or protect her**, rather than reaction-based teams. Since she **cannot be healed normally**, she is not suitable for traditional Vaporize or Melt comps where healers like Bennett or Kokomi are typically staples. Instead, she thrives in **quick-swap or support-heavy teams**. One great team setup is **Arlecchino + Furina + Zhongli + a battery like Xiangling, Dehya (C1+), or even Raiden Shogun**. Furina is her best support\u2014not for healing, but because her HP fluctuations and teamwide damage buffs amplify Arlecchino\u2019s output. **Zhongli** provides crucial shielding and resistance shred, helping protect her during low HP states. **Off-field Pyro units** like Xiangling or **Electro batteries** like Raiden can help maintain Burst uptime while allowing Arlecchino to stay in her infusion window longer. She also works surprisingly well in **mono Pyro teams** or **low-reaction teams**, where Pyro resonance adds more ATK and her internal scaling does the heavy lifting. Teams like **Arlecchino + Xiangling + Furina + Zhongli** or **Arlecchino + Yelan + Zhongli + Raiden** provide a mix of energy, buffs, and shield protection to let her stay on the field and dish out massive numbers. In summary, **Arlecchino is a powerhouse Pyro Hypercarry** who brings a bold, stylish, and risky playstyle with incredible payoffs. She thrives when built around her **Bond of Life mechanic**, dealing huge Pyro damage with minimal need for reactions. Her **dual-phase combat loop**, high damage potential, and independence from traditional healing make her **a unique and satisfying main DPS**, perfect for players who enjoy managing risk for high reward. With proper team support and her signature gear, Arlecchino can become one of the **strongest solo carries in the game**, and a true Harbinger of destruction."}, {"question": "Tell me about wriothesley", "answer": "Wriothesley is a 5-star **Cryo catalyst user** from Fontaine, introduced in *Genshin Impact* Version 4.1. As the charismatic **Duke of the Fortress of Meropide**, Wriothesley breaks traditional catalyst conventions by functioning as a **melee-focused brawler**, dishing out **physical-like Cryo damage** through rapid punches. He is a **main DPS**, excelling in **on-field Cryo application**, **self-sustaining healing**, and high-frequency **Normal Attack damage**, making him ideal for **Freeze**, **Mono Cryo**, and **Hypercarry** teams. With a kit built around HP management and heavy-hitting combos, Wriothesley brings a fast-paced, aggressive playstyle that rewards positioning and timing. Wriothesley\u2019s **Elemental Skill**, *Icefang Rush*, is the core of his playstyle. When activated, he enters a special stance that converts his Normal Attacks into powerful **Cryo-infused melee strikes** for 10 seconds. During this state, his attacks are faster and deal AoE Cryo damage, enabling him to shred through enemies with continuous elemental pressure. These punches deal high damage and apply Cryo consistently, making him ideal for triggering **Freeze** when paired with Hydro units or **Superconduct** with Electro. The stance costs some HP to activate, but this self-damage is easily managed through his built-in healing from his passive talents. His **Elemental Burst**, *Darkgold Wolfbite*, is a massive Cryo strike that deals AoE damage in front of him. It deals more damage based on Wriothesley's **Max HP**, and it **heals him based on the damage dealt**, making it a key component of his **self-sustain loop**. The Burst has a low Energy cost (60) and short animation time, allowing it to be used fluidly in rotations. It isn\u2019t the core of his damage, but it adds burst value and healing, allowing Wriothesley to remain on-field longer without needing a healer. Wriothesley\u2019s **passive talents** enhance his survivability and output. One passive heals him slightly when he falls below a certain HP threshold, allowing him to safely use his Skill without risk of self-KO. Another boosts his **Cryo damage** and Crit Rate while he maintains his enhanced state, rewarding players who keep him on-field and punching nonstop. This design makes him **self-reliant**\u2014he doesn\u2019t require healing supports and thrives in low-healing or shield-based teams. Wriothesley is **strong at C0**, but his **constellations** elevate his damage and ease-of-use. **C1** reduces the HP cost of activating his Skill, making it easier to maintain uptime. **C2** adds bonus damage to his punches based on his Max HP, increasing his scaling significantly. **C4** adds Cryo resistance shred when enemies are frozen or affected by his enhanced punches, making him stronger in **Freeze comps**. **C6** is his biggest spike\u2014it reduces the cooldown of his Skill and boosts his Crit DMG significantly after using his Burst, allowing for **near-continuous Cryo-infused punching** with massive Crit scaling. Even without constellations, Wriothesley performs exceptionally well, but his C6 turns him into a top-tier hypercarry. For **artifacts**, Wriothesley\u2019s best set is **4-piece Marechaussee Hunter**, tailor-made for his HP-draining kit. It increases Normal and Charged Attack damage and grants Crit Rate when his HP changes\u2014perfect for his playstyle, which revolves around HP loss and recovery. Alternatives include **2-piece Blizzard Strayer + 2-piece ATK% or HP%** for early builds or **4-piece Blizzard Strayer** in Freeze teams. For main stats, use **ATK% or HP% Sands** (HP% scales well with his kit), **Cryo DMG Bonus Goblet**, and **Crit DMG or Crit Rate Circlet**, depending on your weapon. Substats should focus on **Crit, ATK%, HP%, and some ER (110\u2013130%)**. In terms of **weapons**, Wriothesley\u2019s **signature weapon**, *Cashflow Supervision*, is his best-in-slot. It gives high Crit Rate, Normal Attack DMG Bonus, and increases ATK when his HP changes\u2014ideal for his punching-heavy kit. Other strong 5-star alternatives include **Skyward Atlas** for ATK and raw damage, **Lost Prayer to the Sacred Winds** for Crit Rate and Elemental DMG stacking, and **Kagura\u2019s Verity** (though it\u2019s more suited for Skill/Burst-focused characters). Among 4-star options, **The Widsith** is a fantastic choice for burst-heavy damage rotations, while **Frostbearer** is more niche but synergizes with Freeze comps. **Flowing Purity** and **Mappa Mare** (crafted) offer Elemental Mastery but aren\u2019t ideal unless you\u2019re building for reactions like Melt, which isn\u2019t Wriothesley\u2019s core strength. Wriothesley fits best into **Mono Cryo**, **Freeze**, and **quick-swap Cryo comps**. In **Mono Cryo**, he works beautifully with **Shenhe**, **Rosaria**, or **Layla**, receiving Cryo buffs and resonance, while someone like **Zhongli** provides a shield and resistance shred. In **Freeze teams**, he pairs excellently with **Hydro supports** like **Kokomi**, **Mona**, or **Xingqiu**, freezing enemies in place and benefiting from Blizzard Strayer\u2019s bonus Crit Rate. He can also fit into **quick-swap teams** with Cryo batteries like **Diona** or **Chongyun**, and even work in **Hypercarry setups** where other units focus on buffing his Normal Attack damage and Cryo output. In summary, **Wriothesley is a hard-hitting, self-sufficient Cryo brawler** who brings a unique blend of **sustained DPS, healing, and rapid Normal Attack pressure**. His HP-based mechanics, fast-paced stance system, and infusion gameplay make him feel unlike any other Cryo character. With minimal support needs, flexible build paths, and powerful self-buffs, Wriothesley shines as a stylish and effective **main carry** for players who love **in-your-face elemental melee combat**\u2014with a cool, frosty twist."}, {"question": "Tell me about Collei", "answer": "Collei is a 4-star **Dendro bow user** from Sumeru, introduced in *Genshin Impact* Version 3.0 as one of the first playable Dendro characters. She serves primarily as an **off-field Dendro applicator and sub-DPS**, offering quick and consistent Dendro damage to support **reaction-based teams**, especially **Aggravate**, **Spread**, **Hyperbloom**, and **Burning** compositions. While she shares similarities with the Dendro Traveler and Nahida in terms of elemental role, Collei shines due to her **ease of use**, **low field time**, and **solid energy generation**, making her a great pick for new players and veterans alike. Collei\u2019s **Elemental Skill**, *Floral Brush*, throws a boomerang that travels out and back, dealing Dendro damage each time it hits. This allows for **two hits of Dendro application** in a small AoE and is great for starting reaction chains with Electro or Hydro characters. The Skill is on a short cooldown and generates **energy particles**, making her an effective battery for other Dendro characters or herself. Though the range is modest, the speed and responsiveness of the skill make it excellent for quick-swapping and low-investment play. Her **Elemental Burst**, *Trump-Card Kitty*, summons Cuilein-Anbar (her little floating companion), who creates a Dendro-damaging zone for 6 seconds. Within this zone, periodic explosions apply Dendro to nearby enemies, enabling **continuous off-field reaction triggers**. This Burst has a moderate energy cost (60) and a decent AoE, making it her main contribution to Dendro application in multi-target scenarios. It is particularly valuable in **Hyperbloom** and **Aggravate** teams where persistent Dendro is needed to keep reactions going while other characters take the field. Collei\u2019s **passive talents** increase her consistency and utility. One of her passives boosts the duration of her Burst\u2019s Dendro field if any of her teammates trigger reactions with it, ensuring more uptime in reaction-based comps. Another talent increases the team\u2019s movement speed slightly if you\u2019re not in combat\u2014a nice exploration bonus. These passives enhance her quality of life and make her a reliable background enabler. While Collei is effective at **C0**, her **constellations** enhance her support and reaction potential. **C1** increases her Skill's energy generation, making rotations smoother. **C2** grants an EM boost to active characters within her Burst, increasing reaction damage\u2014a valuable buff in Hyperbloom or Aggravate comps. **C4** reduces Dendro RES of enemies within her Burst after triggering a Dendro-related reaction, helping amplify team-wide damage. **C6** gives a free Floral Brush throw when she uses her Burst, improving overall Dendro application. These constellations are relatively accessible and each one adds more consistency to her already solid kit. For **artifacts**, Collei\u2019s best-in-slot set is **4-piece Deepwood Memories**, which reduces enemy Dendro resistance when she deals Dendro damage. This effect applies even if she\u2019s off-field, making it perfect for maximizing her team\u2019s Dendro reaction damage. If another unit in your team already uses Deepwood, you can give her **4-piece Instructor** (for an EM buff to the team) or **2-piece EM + 2-piece ER** as a budget alternative. For main stats, go with **Energy Recharge or EM on Sands**, **Dendro DMG Bonus on Goblet**, and **Crit Rate, Crit DMG, or EM on Circlet** depending on your weapon and team setup. If you are building her purely for triggering reactions, **triple EM build** is also a strong option. Her **best weapons** vary based on your build. For reaction-based play, **Elegy for the End** (5-star) is a top-tier option, providing Energy Recharge and an Elemental Mastery/ATK boost for the team. **Favonius Warbow** is a great 4-star option that helps battery the team and improves Burst uptime. **Sacrificial Bow** can also be useful to refresh her Skill cooldown. If you're going for a pure reaction build, **End of the Line** or **Fading Twilight** can be used. For F2P players, **Slingshot** or **Crafted Compound Bow** are early options but less ideal for long-term builds. Collei fits beautifully into **Dendro reaction teams**. In **Hyperbloom**, she pairs with **Hydro applicators** like Xingqiu, Kokomi, or Yelan, and an Electro trigger like Kuki Shinobu or Raiden Shogun to detonate cores. In **Aggravate/Spread** teams, she works with **Nahida**, **Fischl**, and **Beidou**, enabling repeated Electro-Dendro reactions. In **Burning** comps, she can apply Dendro while a Pyro unit like Thoma or Xiangling keeps the enemy burning. In all these teams, her role is to **apply Dendro off-field**, enabling stronger carries or reaction damage units to shine. She also complements **Anemo characters** like Sucrose or Kazuha who swirl Electro or Hydro, spreading those elements around for more cores or Quicken states. In summary, **Collei is a simple, effective, and accessible Dendro support** who offers reliable off-field application, energy generation, and synergy with most reaction types. While not as flashy as Nahida or as powerful as Alhaitham, she is a fantastic enabler in Dendro teams and performs her role well with minimal investment. Whether you\u2019re new to the Dendro element or building a Hyperbloom comp on a budget, Collei is a dependable pick who delivers consistency, flexibility, and reaction uptime in any team she joins."}, {"question": "Tell me about Tighnari", "answer": "Tighnari is a 5-star **Dendro bow user** and the first Dendro 5-star character introduced in *Genshin Impact* Version 3.0. He serves primarily as a **quick-swap main DPS or burst DPS**, specializing in **Charged Attack-based Dendro damage** that scales with **Elemental Mastery (EM)**. Tighnari excels in **Aggravate** and **Spread** reaction teams, thanks to his fast-paced playstyle, low cooldowns, and rapid Dendro application. As a standard banner character, he is relatively accessible and remains one of the most consistent Dendro damage dealers in the game, especially for players seeking a **low-field-time Dendro carry**. Tighnari\u2019s **Elemental Skill**, *Vijnana-Phala Mine*, throws a floral projectile that deals AoE Dendro damage and creates a field called the **Vijnana-Khanda Field**, which taunts enemies and speeds up the charge time of his next three **Wreath Arrows**. These Wreath Arrows are his **Charged Attacks**, and they form the core of his damage. After the arrow hits, it splits into multiple tracking **Clusterbloom Arrows** that automatically seek nearby enemies, each dealing Dendro damage. This mechanic makes Tighnari\u2019s charged shots highly effective in single-target and small-group scenarios. The Skill allows Tighnari to **chain rapid Charged Attacks** without delay, creating a smooth, bursty rotation that rewards precision and quick execution. His **Elemental Burst**, *Fashioner\u2019s Tanglevine Shaft*, launches six fast Dendro arrows that home in on enemies, followed by additional homing Clusterbloom Arrows that deal more Dendro damage. It has a **short cooldown and low energy cost (40)**, making it easy to use every rotation. Though the Burst isn\u2019t the bulk of his damage, it adds considerable burst potential, spreads Dendro quickly, and contributes to his role as a **reaction enabler** in Aggravate or Spread comps. Tighnari\u2019s **passive talents** significantly enhance his synergy with Elemental Mastery builds. His first passive increases the damage of his Wreath Arrows and Clusterbloom Arrows based on his EM, encouraging players to stack EM rather than traditional ATK-focused builds. His second passive improves his movement speed and reduces charge time further while in the Vijnana-Khanda Field, allowing smoother combat flow. These passives make him very easy to build around **Dendro reactions**, and his fast attack style allows players to take full advantage of buffs and auras without long animations or downtime. Tighnari performs very well at **C0**, and his **constellations** enhance his reaction damage and energy economy. **C1** increases his Crit Rate with Wreath Arrows and extends their resistance shred. **C2** grants Elemental Mastery to nearby allies based on Tighnari\u2019s EM when he uses his Skill, offering team utility. **C4** improves Burst damage against enemies affected by Dendro, and **C6** boosts Crit DMG and Crit Rate for Wreath Arrows, significantly enhancing his sustained DPS. While constellations help with his damage output and comfort, he\u2019s very efficient even without them. For **artifacts**, Tighnari\u2019s best-in-slot is **4-piece Deepwood Memories** if no other character in your team is using it. This set reduces enemies\u2019 Dendro resistance and enhances reaction damage, especially Spread. If Deepwood is already being used, **4-piece Gilded Dreams** is his next best option, giving him large boosts to EM and ATK depending on the elemental makeup of your team. For main stats, use **Elemental Mastery or ATK% on Sands**, **Dendro DMG Bonus on Goblet**, and **Crit Rate or Crit DMG on Circlet**, depending on your weapon. Substats should focus on **Crit, EM, and some Energy Recharge** (around 110\u2013130% is usually enough). Tighnari\u2019s **best weapon** is his signature bow, **Hunter\u2019s Path**, which gives Crit Rate and EM-scaling Charged Attack damage\u2014tailor-made for his kit. Other great 5-star options include **Aqua Simulacra**, **Polar Star**, and **Thundering Pulse**, especially if you're leaning into a Crit-heavy build. Among 4-star options, **The Stringless** is excellent for EM scaling and Skill/Burst damage. **Windblume Ode** (if you got it during its event) is also great for EM and ATK buffs. **Prototype Crescent** is an F2P-friendly option, though it requires headshots to trigger its passive, which isn't ideal in fast-paced combat. Tighnari thrives in **Aggravate and Spread teams**, where his frequent Dendro application enables constant reactions. He pairs best with **Electro supports** like **Fischl**, **Yae Miko**, **Raiden Shogun**, or **Kuki Shinobu**, who can apply Electro off-field and enable Aggravate. **Dendro supports** like **Collei** or **Dendro Traveler** can serve as batteries and off-field appliers for resonance and reaction maintenance. An ideal team might be **Tighnari + Fischl + Dendro Traveler + Zhongli**, giving you resonance, reaction support, and protection. He also works in **double Dendro, double Electro** teams for strong resonance buffs and synergy, especially when paired with **Sumeru characters** like **Nahida**, who offers massive EM boosts and persistent Dendro application. In summary, **Tighnari is a quick-swap Charged Attack Dendro DPS** who delivers consistent, fast-paced elemental damage with minimal field time. His rapid Wreath Arrows, strong EM scaling, and smooth gameplay make him an excellent option for players looking to run **Spread or Aggravate teams**. With solid self-sufficiency, flexible team options, and a straightforward playstyle, Tighnari is a reliable and satisfying Dendro carry who fits perfectly into the modern reaction-based meta."}, {"question": "Tell me about Nilou", "answer": "Nilou is a 5-star **Hydro sword user** from Sumeru, introduced in *Genshin Impact* Version 3.1. She is a **specialized Bloom enabler** who transforms how Bloom reactions work through her unique **\u201cBountiful Core\u201d** mechanic. Nilou is built for **pure Dendro-Hydro reaction teams** and thrives as an **on-field support or sub-DPS**, enabling massive AoE damage through her ability to create Bountiful Cores\u2014an enhanced version of Bloom cores that explode faster and deal more damage. Though her team-building options are narrow, Nilou is unmatched in her niche and can carry Bloom teams to incredible heights. Nilou\u2019s **Elemental Skill**, *Dance of Haftkarsvar*, has two stances depending on when you interrupt her dance. Pressing the Skill once activates her **sword dance**, and subsequent taps perform elegant slashes of Hydro damage. However, if you interrupt the dance after the third step by using her **Elemental Skill again**, she enters a **\u201cwhirling\u201d state**, where each Normal Attack sends out Hydro waves, dealing AoE Hydro damage. The sword dance stance is typically used when you want to apply **consistent off-field Hydro** and play Nilou in an **enabler role**, which is ideal in Bountiful Core teams. Her **Elemental Burst**, *Dance of Abzendegi: Distant Dreams, Listening Spring*, deals AoE Hydro damage and applies a lingering **Tranquility Aura** that continues dealing Hydro DMG over time. Though not her main source of damage, it adds valuable Hydro application in Bloom rotations. It has a moderate energy cost (70) and is best used to apply initial Hydro and contribute to triggering cores during rotations. What makes Nilou truly unique is her **passive talent**, *Court of Dancing Petals*. If your party contains **only Hydro and Dendro characters**, her Skill causes Bloom reactions to produce **Bountiful Cores** instead of normal Dendro Cores. These explode much faster (within 0.5 seconds) and have a **larger AoE**, making them incredibly powerful for clearing mobs. These Bountiful Cores scale **only with HP**, not EM or ATK, and **cannot trigger Hyperbloom or Burgeon**\u2014this restriction ensures Nilou\u2019s team comp remains specialized but also hyper-optimized. Her second passive increases the HP of party members and enhances Bountiful Core damage based on her **Max HP**, making her an ideal **HP-stacking Bloom enabler**. Nilou is very effective at **C0**, but her **constellations** enhance her survivability and damage. **C1** boosts her Skill duration and helps you apply more Hydro. **C2** increases Bountiful Core damage when a Bloom is triggered, directly buffing the team\u2019s AoE output. **C4** heals the active character when Bountiful Cores explode, improving team survivability. **C6** gives a **Crit Rate and Crit DMG bonus** to her Skill\u2019s Hydro slashes, adding a personal DPS boost and helping hybrid builds if you choose to invest in her damage more directly. Still, most players will find her **perfectly functional at C0** for her enabling role. When building Nilou, your **main priority is HP%.** Bountiful Core damage scales exclusively with **her Max HP**, so traditional ATK or Crit builds are not ideal. Her **best artifact set** is **2-piece Tenacity of the Millelith + 2-piece Vourukasha\u2019s Glow**, which gives a total of 40% HP bonus. **4-piece Vourukasha\u2019s Glow** is also viable for the extra HP and Skill/Burst damage increase if she\u2019s triggering cores frequently. If you don\u2019t have these, **2-piece Tenacity + 2-piece HP%** or **2-piece Heart of Depth** (for Hydro bonus) are passable. For main stats, run **HP% on Sands**, **HP% on Goblet**, and **HP% or Healing Bonus on Circlet** (if you need more healing from her passive). Substats should also focus on **HP%**, then some **Energy Recharge** (130\u2013150%) for Burst uptime. Nilou\u2019s **best weapon** is her signature sword, **Key of Khaj-Nisut**, which grants massive HP% and boosts EM for party members based on her HP, synergizing perfectly with her Bloom mechanics. **Primordial Jade Cutter** and **Freedom-Sworn** are also solid options for hybrid damage and team buffing. Among 4-star weapons, **Festering Desire** (if you have it) and **Sacrificial Sword** work well for extra Skill uptime. For HP scaling, **Favonius Sword** is helpful for energy generation, especially in F2P teams. **Iron Sting** can also work in EM-focused setups, though HP% is always preferable for Bountiful Core scaling. In terms of **team comps**, Nilou is designed to function exclusively in **Dendro-Hydro-only teams** due to her Bountiful Core restriction. Her best teammates include **Nahida**, **Dendro Traveler**, **Yaoyao**, and **Collei** for consistent Dendro application, and **Kokomi**, **Barbara**, **Xingqiu**, or **Yelan** for Hydro support. A strong team example is **Nilou + Nahida + Kokomi + Yaoyao**, which offers sustained Dendro and Hydro application, healing, and constant Bountiful Core triggering. Kokomi and Yaoyao together allow for full healing and uptime on reactions, while Nahida ensures constant Dendro application. Nilou teams focus on creating **as many cores as possible**, as fast as possible, and allowing Nilou to **amplify the damage** of those cores. You don\u2019t need heavy stats across the board\u2014just **strong elemental uptime**, healing to deal with self-damage from cores, and a tanky Nilou with high HP. She\u2019s ideal in **multi-target scenarios**, where Bountiful Cores can hit several enemies at once, making her one of the best AoE damage enablers in the game under the right conditions. In summary, **Nilou is a niche but immensely powerful Dendro-Hydro enabler**, capable of turning simple Bloom reactions into devastating area-of-effect nukes with her Bountiful Core mechanic. Her HP-scaling build, easy rotation, and strong synergy with a select pool of units make her a **top-tier pick for reaction-focused teams**. While her team-building restrictions limit flexibility, within her niche, she is unmatched\u2014and an absolute must-build for players who love the elegance and chaos of Bloom-based elemental combat."}, {"question": "Tell me about Nahida", "answer": "Nahida is a 5-star Dendro catalyst user introduced in the Sumeru region of Genshin Impact. As the Dendro Archon, she plays a vital role in the game\u2019s lore, but she\u2019s also one of the strongest support and sub-DPS characters you can add to your team. Her playstyle revolves around spreading Dendro reactions efficiently and boosting Elemental Mastery across the team. What makes Nahida unique is her Elemental Skill, *All Schemes to Know*, which allows her to mark multiple enemies with the Seed of Skandha and link them together. When marked enemies take elemental damage, the linked targets all suffer from a coordinated Dendro reaction, effectively amplifying your team's AoE damage. Her skill can be tapped for a quick cast or held for an aiming mode to tag more enemies, and she excels at driving reactions like Bloom, Hyperbloom, and Quicken. Her Elemental Burst, *Illusory Heart*, creates a Shrine of Maya field that offers different bonuses depending on your team\u2019s composition. If your team includes Pyro, Electro, or Hydro characters, the shrine grants various boosts such as improved reaction damage or reduced skill cooldowns. While her Burst has a relatively low energy cost, it benefits from high uptime and supports Nahida's role as a backbone in reaction-based teams. She doesn't need to be on-field to be effective, which makes her incredibly flexible for various team setups. You can run her with Hydro characters like Nilou for Bloom teams, or with Electro units like Raiden Shogun or Kuki Shinobu for powerful Hyperbloom setups. Even Quicken and Aggravate teams with characters like Yae Miko or Fischl see huge benefits from Nahida\u2019s consistent Dendro application. When it comes to building Nahida, you\u2019ll want to focus on Elemental Mastery as her primary stat across her artifacts, especially if you're using her as a reaction enabler. The Deepwood Memories set is her go-to artifact option if she\u2019s your only Dendro unit, as it shreds enemy Dendro resistance and amplifies team-wide Dendro reaction damage. Alternatively, if another character is wearing Deepwood, Nahida can use Gilded Dreams for a huge Elemental Mastery boost. Her best-in-slot weapon is *A Thousand Floating Dreams*, which provides a hefty EM boost and passive team buffs. However, she works extremely well with 4-star weapons like *The Widsith* or even *Sacrificial Fragments*, especially for players who are earlier in the game or don\u2019t have premium options. Nahida\u2019s constellations significantly enhance her capabilities, though she\u2019s already an excellent unit at C0. At C2, she becomes much stronger, granting Crit Rate and Crit Damage to her coordinated attacks based on her Elemental Mastery, which turns her into a viable on-field damage dealer as well. Her C1 improves her Burst uptime and makes her more fluid in battle, while her C6 is a massive leap, essentially converting her into a top-tier main DPS by adding an additional Dendro trigger effect. That said, even without constellations, Nahida brings top-tier utility and damage support to virtually any Dendro-based team. Overall, Nahida is a powerful, easy-to-use character that fits into a wide variety of team comps and enables some of the strongest elemental reactions in the game. Whether you\u2019re building for Bloom or looking to enhance Quicken or Hyperbloom teams, Nahida will quickly become one of the cornerstones of your roster. She's not only strong, but her playstyle is satisfying, with smart targeting mechanics and broad synergy with many characters, making her a top-tier investment for new and veteran players alike."}, {"question": "Tell me about Layla", "answer": "Layla is a 4-star Cryo sword user from Sumeru who excels in providing strong off-field shielding and consistent Cryo application. As an astrologer and student at the Akademiya, she may seem timid, but in combat, she offers excellent defensive utility and Cryo support that fits comfortably into many team archetypes. Her playstyle is centered around her Elemental Skill, *Nights of Formal Focus*, which creates a shield that scales off her max HP. This shield not only absorbs damage efficiently but also generates Night Stars over time when characters protected by it use their skills. After accumulating enough Night Stars, Layla launches homing projectiles that deal Cryo damage to enemies, allowing her to contribute solid off-field Cryo application without needing to stay on the field. Her Elemental Burst, *Dream of the Star-Stream Shaker*, summons a celestial shower that continuously deals AoE Cryo damage in a circle around the active character. While not as potent as some higher-star Cryo Bursts, it offers good energy generation and adds to her Cryo support role, especially in Freeze or Superconduct team setups. Layla's kit doesn't require high field time, so she's often used as a shield-bot and Cryo applicator in teams where your main DPS needs protection or consistent Cryo for reactions. She works especially well with Hydro characters like Ayato, Kokomi, or Xingqiu in Freeze teams, keeping enemies locked down while enabling your main damage dealer to attack safely. When building Layla, the most important stat to focus on is HP, as her shield strength and even her projectile damage scale with it. For artifact sets, *Tenacity of the Millelith* is a strong choice if you're looking to boost teamwide attack while enhancing her shield, especially if she\u2019s consistently triggering her Skill. Alternatively, *Noblesse Oblige* can be used if you want to increase her Burst support potential. As for weapons, *Key of Khaj-Nisut* is her best-in-slot 5-star weapon due to its massive HP% boost and supportive passive, but that\u2019s a luxury. More accessible options include the *Favonius Sword*, which helps with energy generation, or the *Sacrificial Sword* if you want to reduce her Skill cooldown and maintain more uptime on her shield. Layla\u2019s constellations are quite useful, especially for increasing her Cryo output and improving her shield uptime. Her early constellations improve her ability to generate Night Stars and deal more damage with them, while her later constellations add team buffs and increase her shield strength even further. C4 in particular grants the active character a damage bonus based on Layla's max HP, making her more supportive. C6 allows Layla to generate energy more efficiently and reduce cooldowns, creating a more fluid rotation for your whole team. Though not necessary for her to be effective, her constellations steadily elevate her support potential. In essence, Layla is a dependable Cryo support who can keep your team safe while contributing solid Cryo application and energy. She shines in teams that rely on Freeze or Superconduct and is particularly appealing for players who want a reliable shielder that doesn't demand complex mechanics. Her versatility and simplicity make her a great addition to both early and late-game rosters, and she pairs well with many characters, making her a valuable and easy-to-build unit for newer Genshin players."}, {"question": "Tell me about Baizhu", "answer": "Baizhu is a 5-star Dendro catalyst user from Liyue who functions primarily as a healer and support unit with additional Dendro application capabilities. As the gentle and enigmatic owner of Bubu Pharmacy, Baizhu\u2019s role in combat reflects his profession\u2014he provides steady healing, protects the team with a unique shield mechanic, and supports Dendro reactions in a more relaxed, sustain-focused playstyle. Unlike Nahida or Alhaitham, Baizhu is not built for dealing high damage, but instead for keeping your team alive while still enabling core Dendro reactions like Bloom, Hyperbloom, and Quicken. His slower-paced, defensive approach makes him especially useful in teams that want safety and reaction consistency without relying on fast-paced rotations. Baizhu\u2019s Elemental Skill, *Universal Diagnosis*, summons a roaming spirit called a Gossamer Sprite that homes in on enemies and deals Dendro damage, then returns to heal nearby characters based on his max HP. It\u2019s a one-tap skill with low field time, and it contributes to Dendro application while providing healing without needing him to stay on the field. His Elemental Burst, *Holistic Revivification*, creates a seamless flow of protection and healing: it grants a shield that refreshes periodically and heals the active character each time it reactivates. Additionally, when the shield refreshes, it deals Dendro damage to nearby enemies, allowing Baizhu to still play a part in triggering reactions. His shield is unique in that it refreshes multiple times rather than staying up continuously, but the frequency is high enough that it offers near-constant protection. To build Baizhu, focus on maximizing his HP, as both his healing and his shield strength scale directly from it. His best artifact set is *Deepwood Memories*, which reduces enemy Dendro resistance and boosts your team\u2019s reaction damage. Since he doesn't need Elemental Mastery or damage stats, the extra utility from Deepwood is perfect, especially in Dendro-centric teams where reaction damage matters more than raw healing output. If someone else on your team is already using Deepwood, a mixed set with HP% main stats or even *Ocean-Hued Clam* can work, especially if you want to convert some of his healing into additional damage. For weapons, his signature 5-star *Jadefall\u2019s Splendor* enhances his healing and energy regeneration, but other excellent choices include *Prototype Amber* or *Favonius Codex* for F2P players, as they provide energy and healing support. Baizhu\u2019s constellations are designed to make his support smoother and more impactful. His C1 adds extra Dendro damage and healing efficiency, while his C2 provides teamwide Elemental Mastery when characters are healed by his Burst, which significantly boosts reaction-based team damage. Later constellations improve shield uptime, reduce cooldowns, and give additional buffs to the team. While he functions well at C0, players who use him in reaction-heavy teams will benefit greatly from C2, which solidifies him as both a healer and a reaction enhancer. Overall, Baizhu is a calm, stable presence in Dendro teams, ideal for players who value consistent healing, protection, and reaction uptime. He doesn\u2019t offer explosive damage or rapid-fire Dendro application like Nahida, but his strength lies in providing a steady flow of support that keeps your reaction-based teams alive and functioning smoothly. He\u2019s especially valuable in Bloom and Hyperbloom teams that need healing due to self-damage mechanics, such as Nilou-based compositions, but he can also work well in Quicken or Burgeon setups that benefit from reliable Dendro application. For players looking for a laid-back, defensive playstyle that doesn\u2019t compromise on elemental utility, Baizhu is an excellent choice."}, {"question": "Tell me about Yaoyao", "answer": "Yaoyao is a 4-star Dendro polearm user from Liyue, and she serves as a versatile healer and support unit who brings gentle but effective utility to your team. As Ganyu's cheerful junior and Liyue\u2019s first Dendro character, she blends healing, Dendro application, and a bit of off-field disruption in a surprisingly efficient package. Her playstyle is designed to support the team with healing and trigger Dendro reactions, particularly in teams centered around Bloom, Hyperbloom, or Quicken. She\u2019s especially beginner-friendly, offering both survivability and elemental synergy with very simple mechanics. Her Elemental Skill, *Raphanus Sky Cluster*, summons a little Yuegui thrower that hurls White Jade Radishes at enemies and allies. These radishes deal Dendro damage to enemies and heal allies in a small AoE. It\u2019s a smart-targeting mechanic that can simultaneously trigger Dendro reactions and heal nearby characters. If you're running her in reaction-based teams, this consistent application of Dendro goes a long way. Her Elemental Burst, *Moonjade Descent*, puts her into an Adeptal Legacy state, where she summons additional Yuegui that rapidly toss healing radishes while also letting her deal Dendro damage with her attacks. This mode not only ramps up healing dramatically but allows her to work as an on-field Dendro driver for a short time, enabling fast-paced Dendro reactions during her Burst window. In terms of team comps, Yaoyao is flexible and fits well in Bloom-based teams with Hydro characters like Xingqiu, Kokomi, or Nilou, and in Hyperbloom teams alongside Electro supports like Kuki Shinobu or Raiden Shogun. She\u2019s also great for Quicken teams with units like Fischl, Yae Miko, or Cyno, offering a balance of healing and reaction setup. What makes Yaoyao really shine is her healing coverage, especially in Bloom and Burgeon teams that deal self-damage\u2014you can keep your team healthy while still maintaining strong Dendro uptime. For artifacts, Yaoyao's best set is *Deepwood Memories*, which not only supports her own Dendro output but shreds Dendro resistance for the rest of the team. Since her healing and Dendro application scale off HP, you\u2019ll want to build her with a full HP% focus\u2014HP on sands, goblet, and circlet. If another unit is already using Deepwood, a hybrid of *Tenacity of the Millelith* or even a healing set like *Maiden Beloved* can work, but Deepwood is almost always optimal for her utility. For weapons, *Favonius Lance* is her top 4-star choice because it helps with energy generation, allowing her to cast her Burst more frequently. Other good options include *Moonpiercer* or *Kitain Cross Spear* if you want to lean slightly more into reaction support. Yaoyao\u2019s constellations are solid and improve her already reliable kit. C1 reduces cooldowns during her Burst, making her more fluid in rotation. C2 allows her radishes to apply more frequent Dendro, while C4 boosts the healing radius, giving her even better coverage. Her C6 makes her healing even stronger and grants Elemental Mastery to active characters, which directly boosts reaction damage. Although she\u2019s already highly usable at C0, getting a few constellations really enhances her comfort and reaction support in longer fights or tougher content like Spiral Abyss. All in all, Yaoyao is a dependable and surprisingly effective Dendro healer who brings a lot of value to reaction-based teams while being easy to use and build. Whether you need a supportive unit in your Nilou Bloom team or just want consistent Dendro application with safety baked in, Yaoyao is a fantastic pick. Her cheerful personality and fun mechanics make her a joy to play, and she\u2019s especially good for players who want to explore Dendro reactions without sacrificing team durability."}, {"question": "Tell me about Chaska", "answer": "Chasca is a 5-star Anemo bow character from the Natlan region in *Genshin Impact*, known as the \u201cPeacemaker of the Tlalocan.\u201d She stands out not just for her elegant design and tribal heritage, but also for her unique gameplay mechanics and flexible role in combat. Unlike some Anemo characters who focus purely on crowd control or support, Chasca serves as an on-field elemental damage dealer who thrives by absorbing and converting other elements. Her abilities revolve around synergy with her teammates, especially those of Pyro, Hydro, Cryo, or Electro, making her an extremely versatile unit who rewards creative team building and reaction-focused playstyles. Chasca\u2019s playstyle centers around her ability to absorb elemental energy from her teammates and infuse it into her attacks, especially her charged shots. Her Elemental Skill allows her to gather the element of the active teammate and infuse it into her next few shots, which then deal Anemo damage with a twist\u2014it takes on characteristics of the absorbed element. This makes her a dynamic reaction-based DPS, somewhat like a reverse Swirl mechanism. She can adapt to the element present in the party and then dish out powerful follow-up attacks that deal combined Anemo and elemental damage. Her Elemental Burst further empowers this by sending out a flurry of charged projectiles that interact with enemies in an AoE, again using the infused element. This means her kit is very much built around elemental flexibility and fluid rotations, so players need to think a bit ahead when pairing her with teammates. When it comes to team composition, Chasca can pair with many of the elemental staples in the game. Pyro characters like Bennett or Xiangling let her trigger Vaporize or Overloaded effects; Hydro allies like Xingqiu or Yelan enable consistent Hydro application for Freeze or Vaporize setups; Electro teammates like Fischl or Raiden can be used for Electro-Charged or Overloaded; and Cryo characters like Rosaria or Kaeya allow for Freeze or Superconduct. This wide compatibility means she can slot into many elemental reaction teams, but it also means you\u2019ll get the most out of her by matching her with characters that offer fast, consistent elemental application to fuel her skill and burst. Chasca benefits from artifact sets that enhance her elemental damage or enable her to capitalize on reaction scaling. *Viridescent Venerer* is a classic option for Anemo characters, but since she isn't a pure support or Swirl spammer, many players opt for more DPS-focused builds. Sets like *Marechaussee Hunter* (which boosts crit and normal/charged attack damage) or *Wanderer\u2019s Troupe* (which boosts Elemental Mastery and charged attacks) are viable alternatives depending on your stat spread and playstyle. For stats, you'll want a healthy balance of Crit Rate, Crit Damage, and Elemental Mastery, especially if you're focusing on reaction damage. Her main damage source is her infused charged shots, so stats that boost those are a top priority. In terms of weapons, Chasca performs well with bows that increase her elemental or charged attack damage. Her signature 5-star weapon (if released with her) will likely be tailored for her kit, but other good options include *Polar Star* for overall damage bonuses, *Aqua Simulacra* for high crit stats, or even *The Stringless* for boosting her elemental skill and burst at 4-star rarity. F2P players can consider *Prototype Crescent* if you\u2019re comfortable aiming at weak points, or *Favonius Warbow* for utility if you want to help with team energy. Chasca's constellations enhance her reactive capabilities and improve the fluidity of her elemental absorption and charged attacks. Early constellations may increase the duration or strength of her elemental infusion, while later ones can reduce cooldowns, improve energy gain, or enhance crit damage based on absorbed elements. These constellations don\u2019t necessarily make or break her, as she\u2019s strong and functional at C0, but they do add a lot of polish to her rotation and damage potential if you decide to invest further. Overall, Chasca is a flexible and reaction-driven DPS who brings something fresh to the Anemo roster. While she may not offer the raw Swirl-focused utility of characters like Sucrose or Kazuha, she compensates with her unique elemental mimicry and the ability to adapt to whatever team you build around her. For new players, she teaches the value of elemental synergy and reaction timing, while offering a smooth and satisfying combat rhythm. If you enjoy a character who feels fluid, supports team creativity, and has a strong narrative identity tied to peace and tradition, Chasca is a beautifully designed and highly enjoyable pick."}, {"question": "Tell me about Ororon", "answer": "Ororon is a 4-star Electro bow user introduced in *Genshin Impact*\u2019s Natlan region, known for his silent poise and mysterious affiliation with the Masters of the Night-Wind\u2014a secretive order believed to navigate between realms of reality and myth. Unlike more flamboyant characters, Ororon exudes a calm, calculating presence. His aesthetic is sleek and shadowed, reflecting his covert background, and his lore hints at someone who observes far more than he speaks. For new players, Ororon offers a unique entry point into understanding Electro application mechanics and reaction-based sub-DPS roles. Ororon's combat style is built around consistent, off-field Electro application and reaction synergy, especially with Hydro characters. His Elemental Skill, *Shadowcurrent Bolt*, fires a precision arrow that marks enemies with a \u201cNighttrace.\u201d Once marked, enemies struck by Hydro or Cryo will trigger a burst of AoE Electro damage. This ability is excellent for enabling Electro-Charged or Superconduct reactions, and the Nighttrace can stay active for a short time even after Ororon leaves the field. His Elemental Burst, *Eclipse Veil*, summons a stationary construct called the Veiled Lantern, which periodically releases homing bolts of Electro damage to nearby enemies. It scales with his Elemental Mastery and allows him to act as a reliable off-field sub-DPS who constantly contributes to elemental reactions while the main DPS rotates in. Ororon\u2019s best team compositions focus on enabling Electro-Charged and other elemental reactions. He pairs naturally with Hydro characters like Xingqiu, Yelan, Kokomi, or even Candace for consistent Hydro uptime, allowing Electro-Charged to trigger frequently. He also synergizes well with Cryo units like Rosaria or Kaeya in teams aiming for Superconduct for Physical DPS builds, and in Aggravate teams with Dendro and Electro characters like Nahida and Fischl, where his steady Electro application and EM scaling become even more valuable. While Ororon can function as a quasi-DPS in some teams, his real strength lies in enabling the main carry through consistent Electro presence and energy generation. For artifacts, Ororon benefits most from *Thundering Fury* for increased Electro damage and reduced skill cooldowns if you plan to play him more actively. If you're running him off-field in reaction-heavy teams, *Golden Troupe* becomes a strong choice, as it boosts his Elemental Skill damage significantly while he's off the field. Another viable option is *Gilded Dreams* if you\u2019re focusing on Elemental Mastery and reaction output. The main stats to focus on are Elemental Mastery or ATK% on the sands (depending on your reaction focus), Electro DMG Bonus on the goblet, and Crit Rate or Crit DMG on the circlet. EM becomes a priority in teams where Ororon is primarily used to trigger Electro-Charged or Aggravate. Weapon-wise, Ororon has a handful of strong bow options. *The Stringless* is an excellent 4-star weapon that enhances both Elemental Skill and Burst damage while providing Elemental Mastery\u2014perfect for reaction-focused builds. *Elegy for the End*, a 5-star support bow, enhances Elemental Mastery and Energy Recharge and provides a team-wide buff upon triggering reactions, which fits seamlessly into his kit. If you\u2019re going for a more energy-focused build, *Favonius Warbow* is a viable 4-star alternative, especially if your team struggles with energy regeneration. F2P options include *End of the Line* or *Hamayumi* depending on whether you want to focus on raw damage or skill spam. Ororon's constellations scale very well with his intended role. His C1 improves his skill\u2019s mark duration and allows it to spread to nearby enemies, making his Electro application more efficient in AoE scenarios. C2 boosts the damage dealt by reactions triggered from Nighttrace marks. His C4 increases his Burst\u2019s duration and adds additional energy regeneration for the team, a particularly valuable constellation in multi-element comps. At C6, Ororon gains a crit damage buff when hitting marked enemies, making him a more potent damage dealer. That said, he functions well even at C0, especially if built properly and paired with strong Hydro enablers. Overall, Ororon is an elegant and effective sub-DPS character who thrives in reaction-heavy team setups. His calm demeanor and reactive playstyle make him a satisfying and strategic character to master. For newer players looking to understand how elemental synergy and off-field damage work, Ororon provides an intuitive but deep introduction to those mechanics. While he doesn\u2019t overwhelm enemies with flashy bursts, he chips away at them with precise, reaction-fueled attacks and supports the team with consistency and control. Whether you\u2019re diving into Electro-Charged, Superconduct, or Aggravate, Ororon is a versatile and stylish partner on the battlefield."}, {"question": "Tell me about Mavuika", "answer": "Mavuika is a 5-star Pyro claymore character in *Genshin Impact* and the Pyro Archon of Natlan, the Nation of War and Passion. She stands as a powerful symbol of fierce leadership, divine authority, and primal flame. Known by her ancient name *Kiongozi* and her Goetic title *Haborym*, Mavuika is not just a deity of destruction\u2014she is the embodiment of righteous wrath, the strength of unity in battle, and the voice that stokes the flames of rebellion and resilience. Her presence radiates the fire of a nation built on conflict, yet her lore also reveals layers of wisdom, protection, and sacrifice. For players stepping into Natlan, Mavuika represents the heart of the region\u2019s identity\u2014proud, fiery, and unrelenting. In combat, Mavuika is an aggressive on-field DPS with a unique mechanic that encourages fast-paced, explosive gameplay. Her Elemental Skill, *The Named Moment*, unleashes a wide Pyro-infused claymore slash that marks enemies with the Ring of Searing Radiance. This mark lingers on enemies, triggering periodic Pyro damage and boosting the effects of Pyro-based reactions such as Vaporize, Overloaded, and Burning. Hitting marked enemies with charged or plunge attacks detonates the mark early, causing a burst of AoE Pyro damage. This creates a skill loop that rewards active engagement and positional awareness, as players can maximize her damage by managing cooldowns and spacing. Her Elemental Burst, *Warcry of the Kindled Flame*, is a battlefield-shifting ultimate that summons a storm of Pyro energy around Mavuika. This burst boosts her attack speed, converts a portion of her normal and charged attacks into Pyro damage, and enhances any reactions triggered by her attacks during its duration. In addition, her Burst grants the \u201cEmberchant\u201d buff to nearby allies, increasing their attack power and Pyro resistance, reinforcing her status as both a battlefield commander and a solo powerhouse. Unlike more methodical claymore users, Mavuika feels fluid and aggressive\u2014her animations are sweeping, fast, and laced with fire trails that create a constant sense of motion. Mavuika thrives in teams designed around elemental reactions. She pairs exceptionally well with Hydro units like Xingqiu, Yelan, or Furina to constantly trigger Vaporize, greatly amplifying her Pyro output. Electro characters like Fischl, Raiden, or Beidou can bring Overloaded into the mix for wide area damage and stagger potential. She also fits nicely into Burning or Burgeon teams with Dendro allies like Nahida, Baizhu, or Collei, leveraging her fast attack string to ignite the battlefield. Mavuika\u2019s versatility allows her to serve as a main carry in many elemental reaction comps, and she even offers team utility with her Emberchant support buff. In terms of artifact sets, Mavuika shines with the *Crimson Witch of Flames* set, which increases both her Pyro damage and the power of her reactions. For reaction-focused builds, *Gilded Dreams* or *Lavawalker* can also be effective, depending on whether you\u2019re aiming for pure Pyro output or EM-scaling reaction damage. Stat-wise, she benefits from a traditional DPS spread: ATK% or Elemental Mastery on sands depending on playstyle, Pyro DMG Bonus on the goblet, and Crit Rate/Crit DMG on the circlet. Because of her focus on elemental damage and reactions, EM becomes more important in teams that heavily rely on reaction chains. Her weapon choice is similarly flexible but benefits from high base stats and elemental synergy. Her signature 5-star claymore (expected to release alongside her) will likely enhance her Elemental Skill and Burst damage or boost reaction scaling. Until then, strong alternatives include *Wolf\u2019s Gravestone* for raw ATK support, *Redhorn Stonethresher* for crit-heavy builds, or *Serpent Spine* if you're using her in a crit-focused setup. F2P options like *Prototype Archaic* or *Mailed Flower* can work well with the right artifacts and EM investment. Mavuika\u2019s constellations further deepen her aggressive potential. Her early constellations improve the Ring of Searing Radiance, increasing the explosion radius and reaction amplification. Mid-tier constellations reduce cooldowns and increase energy regeneration, while later constellations\u2014especially her C6\u2014unlock powerful enhancements to her Burst, including additional attack scaling and guaranteed critical hits under certain conditions. She is strong and functional at C0, but like most Archons, her constellations elevate her ceiling considerably for players who want to maximize her full potential. Overall, Mavuika is a Pyro character who captures the essence of Natlan: fierce, fast, reaction-driven, and rich with lore. She offers a playstyle that feels both fluid and forceful, rewarding players who love staying active on the field and chaining reactions. Whether you admire her for her divine narrative, her combat elegance, or her explosive capabilities, Mavuika is an unforgettable addition to Genshin Impact\u2019s roster\u2014and a Pyro Archon that commands the battlefield like no other."}, {"question": "Tell me about Eula", "answer": "Eula is a 5-star Cryo claymore character from Mondstadt in *Genshin Impact*, best known for her powerful physical damage and elegant, dance-like combat style. She hails from the Lawrence Clan, a formerly aristocratic family infamous for its cruelty, but Eula herself has rejected their legacy, instead serving as the captain of the Reconnaissance Company of the Knights of Favonius. Her storyline is deeply rooted in themes of redemption, independence, and pride masked under her sarcastic demeanor. For new players, Eula introduces a different kind of Cryo character\u2014one who isn't primarily about elemental reactions, but instead about raw, devastating physical DPS. Eula's playstyle is centered around building and releasing massive bursts of physical damage, with Cryo acting as a support element rather than a reaction trigger. Her Elemental Skill, *Icetide Vortex*, has both a tap and hold variation. The tap deals quick Cryo damage and grants a stack of 'Grimheart,' a defensive buff that increases her resistance to interruption and physical resistance. Holding the skill consumes Grimheart stacks to deal a powerful AoE Cryo slash and reduce the physical and Cryo resistance of enemies hit, making it a key part of her rotation to prepare for her ultimate. Her Elemental Burst, *Glacial Illumination*, is what defines her kit. Upon activation, Eula slams her claymore into the ground, dealing AoE Cryo damage and summoning a 'Lightfall Sword' that follows her for 7 seconds. During this time, every normal attack, elemental skill hit, and burst-related effect contributes stacks to the sword. At the end of the duration\u2014or if she leaves the field\u2014the Lightfall Sword explodes, dealing an enormous amount of physical damage based on the stacks accumulated. This burst can easily deal hundreds of thousands of damage with the right build, and managing its timing and setup is crucial to mastering her. Team-building for Eula is focused around supporting her physical damage and helping her build stacks for her burst. She benefits greatly from characters who can provide superconduct reactions\u2014Electro and Cryo combined\u2014to reduce enemy physical resistance. Good Electro partners include Raiden Shogun, Fischl, and Lisa, while Cryo allies like Rosaria or Diona can help with resonance, Cryo application, and support. Shielders such as Zhongli or Diona are also very valuable, since Eula needs to stay on-field during her burst duration to fully charge it and cannot afford to be interrupted. Battery units like Raiden or Rosaria are especially useful to help keep her burst available off cooldown due to its high energy cost. Eula\u2019s best artifact set is *Pale Flame*, which increases both physical damage and attack, and has a synergy with her skill usage. A 2-piece *Pale Flame* + 2-piece *Bloodstained Chivalry* is another strong option if you don\u2019t have a perfect 4-piece set. Main stats to prioritize include ATK% on sands, Physical DMG Bonus on the goblet, and Crit Rate or Crit DMG on the circlet, depending on your weapon. Substats should focus on Crit Rate, Crit DMG, and some Energy Recharge to help her consistently use her burst. Unlike many other DPS units, Elemental Mastery isn't important for Eula because she doesn\u2019t rely heavily on elemental reactions for her damage output. When it comes to weapons, Eula has access to some of the best claymores in the game. Her signature weapon, *Song of Broken Pines*, is perfect for her, offering high base ATK, physical damage bonus, and a team-wide attack buff. *Wolf\u2019s Gravestone* is also excellent, increasing attack massively when enemies are below a certain HP threshold. *Serpent Spine* is a strong battle pass option that increases crit stats at the cost of survivability, and *Luxurious Sea-Lord* or *Snow-Tombed Starsilver* can serve as solid free-to-play alternatives with physical damage boosts. Eula\u2019s constellations are all geared toward improving her damage potential and ease of use. Her first constellation allows her to generate more energy with her elemental skill, easing her burst uptime issues. C2 reduces skill cooldowns, while C3 and C5 improve her talent levels. At C6, Eula gains the ability to ignore a large portion of an enemy's physical resistance when she uses her burst, pushing her damage output to monstrous levels\u2014especially in tough boss fights. However, Eula is entirely viable and extremely strong even at C0, provided her team and artifacts are well-optimized. In summary, Eula is a powerhouse physical DPS who offers a distinct playstyle focused on heavy-hitting burst damage and clean, elegant combos. Her gameplay rewards proper timing, setup, and staying in control during fights to maximize her Lightfall Sword. For players who enjoy big damage numbers and a more traditional melee experience with a unique twist, Eula is an incredibly satisfying character to play and invest in. She's a queen of physical damage and brings grace, strength, and a touch of icy attitude to every battle she enters."}, {"question": "Tell me about Lan yan", "answer": "\ue200i\ue202turn0image0\ue202turn0image1\ue202turn0image2\ue202turn0image5\ue201Lan Yan is a 4-star Anemo Catalyst user from Chenyu Vale, introduced in *Genshin Impact* Version 5.3.

He\u2019s a character full of charm, humor, and chaotic energy, but beneath the jokes lies a powerhouse of a DPS unit. Itto is built entirely around a fast-paced, hard-hitting style that revolves around his unique charged attacks and Geo scaling, making him a standout for players who enjoy strong, satisfying burst damage and stylish animations. In battle, Itto is a pure main DPS. His kit revolves around maximizing his Normal and Charged Attacks while in his powered-up state. His Elemental Skill, *Masatsu Zetsugi: Akaushi Burst!*, throws Ushi, a small bull that taunts enemies and deals Geo damage on impact. Ushi acts as both a minor support unit and a stack generator for Itto\u2019s 'Superlative Superstrength,' which is the key mechanic behind his powerful charged attacks. Each stack of Superlative Superstrength allows Itto to unleash a rapid flurry of slashes with his claymore at no stamina cost, making his combos feel fluid and explosive. The centerpiece of his kit is his Elemental Burst, *Royal Descent: Behold, Itto the Evil!*. When activated, Itto enters a state that converts all his Normal and Charged Attacks into Geo damage, increases his attack speed, and boosts his attack based on his defense stat. While in this state, he can rapidly generate and consume stacks of Superlative Superstrength, turning him into a whirlwind of Geo-powered slashes. This burst is what makes Itto such a satisfying DPS to play\u2014each attack feels weighty, fast, and impactful, especially with the visual flair he brings to every move. Because of how Itto scales\u2014particularly with DEF\u2014his team building and artifact setup are slightly different from most standard DPS characters. His best artifact set is the 4-piece *Husk of Opulent Dreams*, which boosts both his defense and Geo damage. It fits him perfectly, providing consistent DEF bonuses during combat and enhancing his output significantly. You\u2019ll want to aim for DEF% on sands, Geo DMG Bonus on the goblet, and Crit Rate or Crit DMG on the circlet depending on your weapon. Substats should focus on Crit, DEF%, and a bit of Energy Recharge to help keep his Burst ready. Itto\u2019s ideal weapon is his signature claymore, *Redhorn Stonethresher*, which boosts both his Crit DMG and DEF-based attack scaling. It synergizes incredibly well with his kit and maximizes his burst window damage. Other solid weapon options include *Serpent Spine* (if you're good at avoiding damage), *Whiteblind* (a free-to-play DEF-scaling weapon that fits Itto nicely), and *The Unforged* (for shield-heavy comps with characters like Zhongli). Team-wise, Itto performs best in mono-Geo or Geo-heavy compositions. He benefits heavily from Geo Resonance, which increases shield strength and boosts damage while shielded. Albedo and Gorou are two of his best supports\u2014Albedo provides passive off-field Geo damage, while Gorou buffs defense, Geo damage, and Crit based on his constellations. Zhongli offers unmatched shielding, which allows Itto to remain uninterrupted during his burst. Yun Jin can also be used for her normal attack boost, although she works best at higher investment. Itto\u2019s constellations push his playstyle even further. His C1 allows Ushi to generate more energy, helping with his energy needs. C2 reduces cooldowns and lets him stay in his burst state longer. His C4 increases crit rate for party members, and his C6 gives him max stacks at the start of his burst and greatly increases his attack speed, making him an absolute monster in damage output. However, Itto is fully functional and fun at C0, and players can enjoy his full playstyle without needing constellations. Overall, Arataki Itto is a fantastic character for players who want a dedicated main DPS with a flashy, rhythm-based combo system and a ton of personality. His performance on the field matches his outrageous confidence, and when supported properly, he can dominate most content with ease. He\u2019s the heart and soul of a mono-Geo team and proves that defense really can be the best offense\u2014especially when delivered with as much style and attitude as the one-and-only Arataki Numero Uno Itto."}, {"question": "Tell me about Barbara", "answer": "Barbara is a 4-star Hydro catalyst user from Mondstadt in Genshin Impact. She serves as the Deaconess of the Church of Favonius and is beloved for her kind heart and musical healing. She's often the first healer players receive and teaches early game survival and team support.\n\nHer playstyle revolves around healing and Hydro application. Her Elemental Skill, *Let the Show Begin♪*, creates a Melody Loop that continuously heals the active character and applies Hydro to nearby enemies. Her Elemental Burst, *Shining Miracle♪*, instantly heals all party members based on Barbara’s max HP, acting as a team-wide emergency heal.\n\nIn terms of artifacts, Barbara performs best with the 4-piece *Ocean-Hued Clam* set for both healing and some damage. Alternatively, 4-piece *Maiden Beloved* is a good beginner option. Focus on HP% for Sands, Goblet, and Circlet, and look for Energy Recharge as a substat to help recharge her Burst.\n\nFor weapons, her best 3-star option is *Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers*, which boosts the next character’s ATK after switching. Other good picks include *Prototype Amber* for more healing and energy, or *Everlasting Moonglow* as her 5-star signature catalyst.\n\nTeam-wise, Barbara fits into Freeze (Cryo + Hydro) or Vaporize (Hydro + Pyro) comps. She works well with characters like Diluc, Xiangling, Kaeya, and Ayaka. Be cautious though: her Skill applies Hydro to your own character, which can trigger negative reactions like Frozen.\n\nHer constellations improve healing and utility. C1 restores energy when healing low-HP characters. C4 gives a passive resurrection every 15 minutes. C6 lets her normal attacks heal all party members, making her a strong passive healer.\n\nLore-wise, Barbara is Jean’s younger sister and dreams of being an idol, spreading happiness through song. Her cheerful personality and supportive gameplay make her one of the most approachable and useful characters for new players."}, {"question": "Tell me about Mona", "answer": "Mona is a 5-star Hydro catalyst user from Mondstadt, known not only for her elegant astrology and dramatic flair, but also for being one of the most versatile and powerful support and sub-DPS characters in *Genshin Impact*. She\u2019s an astrologer who often finds herself broke despite her immense knowledge, but on the battlefield, she\u2019s anything but helpless. Mona excels at enabling high-damage burst combos, applying consistent Hydro, and amplifying the team's overall damage through her unique Elemental Burst. In combat, Mona is best used as a support or sub-DPS, and her strength lies in her ability to enhance burst damage and apply Hydro for elemental reactions. Her Elemental Skill, *Mirror Reflection of Doom*, summons a phantom that taunts enemies and periodically deals Hydro damage before exploding. This skill serves multiple purposes: it distracts enemies, applies Hydro consistently, and builds energy for her Burst. It\u2019s especially effective in reaction-based teams like Freeze or Vaporize setups, where you need constant Hydro application to trigger powerful combos. Mona\u2019s signature move is her Elemental Burst, *Stellaris Phantasm*, which traps enemies in a bubble of illusory water, applies the Ome debuff that increases the damage they take, and triggers a delayed explosion that deals massive Hydro damage. This Omen effect is what makes Mona so special\u2014it multiplies the damage of the next hit taken by the enemies, including damage from other characters. This makes her one of the best supports for setting up nuke-style one-shot combos, especially when paired with characters like Ayaka, Hu Tao, Ganyu, or even Raiden Shogun. Building Mona properly means leaning into her role as a damage amplifier and Hydro applier. For artifacts, she works extremely well with the 4-piece *Noblesse Oblige* set, which boosts her Burst damage and increases the ATK of your entire team after using it. If you're focusing more on elemental reactions and damage output, a 2-piece combo of *Noblesse Oblige* and *Heart of Depth* or *Emblem of Severed Fate* is also strong. For stats, prioritize Energy Recharge on sands (to fuel her high-cost Burst), Hydro DMG Bonus on the goblet, and Crit Rate or Crit DMG on the circlet, depending on your weapon and team setup. Substats should focus on Crit stats, Energy Recharge, and some ATK%. When it comes to weapons, Mona benefits from catalysts that boost her Energy Recharge, Crit stats, or Elemental Burst damage. *The Widsith* is a top-tier 4-star choice that gives a random buff\u2014one of which can significantly boost her damage. *Favonius Codex* helps with energy generation for herself and the team. *Hakushin Ring* is a great craftable weapon in Electro-Charged teams. Her signature 5-star weapon, *Skyward Atlas*, increases Elemental DMG and gives her a strong stat stick, while *Lost Prayer to the Sacred Winds* provides Crit Rate and movement speed, helping with a hybrid DPS role. Mona\u2019s constellations enhance both her utility and damage. C1 allows her normal attacks to deal Hydro damage after using her skill, enabling more sustained reactions. C2 extends the duration of the Omen debuff, making her even better in burst setups. Her later constellations add Crit Rate, reduce stamina consumption, and even grant a significant DMG bonus when her attacks hit enemies affected by Omen. While she\u2019s highly effective at C0, each constellation adds noticeable value, especially C2 for reaction-based teams. Mona fits incredibly well into Freeze teams with Cryo characters like Ayaka or Ganyu, and she\u2019s also amazing in Vaporize comps with Pyro units like Hu Tao or Bennett. Her ability to apply Hydro and boost damage makes her an ideal quick-swap support: you bring her in, apply Omen, switch to your DPS, and detonate the combo for enormous damage. She also pairs well with crowd-control characters like Venti, Kazuha, or Sucrose, who can group enemies and swirl Hydro or Cryo for maximum AoE impact. In short, Mona is a stylish, smart, and powerful character who rewards players for smart timing and team coordination. She\u2019s a master of illusions and manipulation, both narratively and mechanically, and her ability to boost damage output makes her invaluable in high-end content like Spiral Abyss. For newer players, she teaches the power of elemental reactions and damage amplification, while more experienced players can use her to enable massive nukes and elegantly finish off tough enemies. Whether you\u2019re using her as a reaction enabler, debuffer, or burst DPS, Mona adds beauty, grace, and explosive potential to any team."}, {"question": "Tell me about Kokomi", "answer": "Sangonomiya Kokomi is a 5-star Hydro catalyst user from Inazuma and the Divine Priestess of Watatsumi Island. Her serene demeanor, strategic mind, and unwavering dedication to her people are reflected directly in her gameplay\u2014Kokomi is one of the most consistent and reliable healers in *Genshin Impact*, while also offering strong Hydro application and surprising off-field damage when built properly. While early perceptions labeled her as \u201cnot a DPS,\u201d players soon discovered her true strength lies in her hybrid role as a healer, enabler, and driver for reaction-based teams. Kokomi\u2019s Elemental Skill, *Kurage\u2019s Oath*, summons a jellyfish-like Bake-Kurage that deals Hydro damage in a set area and heals active characters over time. This jellyfish scales with Kokomi\u2019s max HP and applies Hydro at a steady rate, making it excellent for reactions like Electro-Charged, Vaporize, or Freeze. It also heals the active character every few seconds, giving your team constant sustain. This ability stays on the field even when you switch characters, which makes Kokomi a great support in quick-swap or reaction-heavy teams. Her Elemental Burst, *Nereid\u2019s Ascension*, transforms Kokomi into a water-walking, damage-dealing healer. It boosts her normal and charged attacks based on her max HP, converts them to Hydro damage, and significantly increases her healing capabilities. During this time, every attack she lands heals your team, meaning Kokomi becomes an on-field driver who can dish out consistent Hydro while keeping the entire team healthy. This mode makes her an ideal fit for reaction-focused teams like Electro-Charged or Freeze comps, especially when paired with characters like Fischl, Beidou, Ayaka, Ganyu, or Rosaria. Kokomi\u2019s build is centered around HP scaling, healing bonus, and some Energy Recharge. The best artifact set for her is the 4-piece *Ocean-Hued Clam*, which not only boosts her healing but converts excess healing into bursts of physical damage, giving her team some free DPS. If you\u2019re focusing on pure healing or don't have Clam yet, a 4-piece *Tenacity of the Millelith* or a 2-piece combo of HP% and Healing Bonus sets can also work. Stat-wise, go for HP% on sands and goblet, and Healing Bonus on the circlet. If you\u2019re using her as a driver in reaction teams, you can also consider a Hydro DMG goblet and some Crit stats if you're comfortable with her unique passive. One thing to note about Kokomi is that she has a special passive that decreases her Crit Rate by 100%, meaning she cannot crit under normal circumstances. This caused confusion at first, but it\u2019s actually freeing\u2014players can focus purely on HP, Healing Bonus, and flat damage rather than investing in Crit stats. Because of this, her damage is stable and reliable, though not reliant on high variance spikes. When it comes to weapons, Kokomi\u2019s signature 5-star weapon, *Everlasting Moonglow*, is perfect for her. It boosts HP, Healing Bonus, and enhances her normal attack damage during her Burst. However, she also performs excellently with several 4-star and even 3-star options. *Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers* is an incredible 3-star catalyst that gives a huge ATK buff to your next character when you switch off Kokomi\u2014perfect for support Kokomi builds. *Prototype Amber* is another strong craftable option that provides energy regeneration and healing, making it great for sustainability in longer fights. Kokomi\u2019s constellations mostly enhance her healing and damage potential. At C1, her jellyfish stays on the field longer when switching, improving uptime. C2 increases her team\u2019s resistance and provides damage bonuses while under her Burst. C4 helps regenerate energy when using normal attacks, while C6 gives a flat 40% Hydro damage bonus when in her Burst state\u2014making her a legitimate sub-DPS or even main DPS at high investment. Even at C0, however, Kokomi is fully capable and doesn't need constellations to fulfill her role. In terms of team building, Kokomi works beautifully in Freeze teams with Cryo units like Ayaka or Ganyu, applying Hydro non-stop to freeze enemies while also healing. In Electro-Charged comps, she\u2019s a great on-field driver with characters like Fischl, Beidou, or Raiden Shogun. She can also be used in Vaporize teams with Xiangling or Bennett for solid damage support. Because her jellyfish applies Hydro continuously, she can serve as the backbone of many reaction-based teams, while also offering the comfort of full-team healing and sustain. Overall, Kokomi is an elegant and calming force on the battlefield. She brings stability, consistency, and flexibility to any team, and is especially valuable for players who want a reliable healer without sacrificing Hydro application or team synergy. Her style is soothing but deceptively powerful\u2014whether she\u2019s walking on water, applying Hydro to an entire horde of enemies, or simply keeping your party alive through the toughest fights, Kokomi is a perfect blend of strength, strategy, and serenity."}, {"question": "Tell me about Yelan", "answer": "Yelan is a 5-star Hydro bow user from Liyue, and she excels as a high-damage, off-field sub-DPS who blends mobility, elemental utility, and burst damage into one extremely stylish package. She\u2019s an enigmatic character affiliated with the Ministry of Civil Affairs, often working in the shadows and handling situations that fall outside the bounds of the law. That same elusive and calculated nature translates directly into her gameplay\u2014Yelan is all about fast movement, rapid Hydro application, and setting up devastating damage for your main DPS. At the heart of Yelan\u2019s kit is her Elemental Skill, *Lingering Lifeline*, which lets her dash through enemies in a unique and swift motion, marking them and dealing Hydro damage when the dash ends or is triggered manually. The skill can be held to extend the duration and dash path, allowing her to weave through large groups of enemies and apply Hydro to all of them at once. It\u2019s not only satisfying to use but also highly practical for quick grouping and repositioning, especially in Spiral Abyss or when fighting mobs. Her skill also generates a good amount of energy, helping her fuel her Elemental Burst frequently. Yelan\u2019s true power lies in her Elemental Burst, *Depth-Clarion Dice*, which creates an \u201cExquisite Throw\u201d that follows your active character and deals coordinated Hydro damage every time you perform a Normal Attack. This effect is similar to Xingqiu\u2019s Burst, but Yelan\u2019s deals more damage and scales with her max HP. It makes her an ideal sub-DPS who can apply consistent Hydro off-field while enabling reactions like Vaporize, Freeze, or Electro-Charged. The dice also allow her to support almost any on-field DPS who uses normal attacks, from Hu Tao and Yoimiya to Cyno and Ayato. For artifacts, Yelan\u2019s best-in-slot set is the 4-piece *Emblem of Severed Fate*, which boosts her Energy Recharge and significantly increases her Burst damage based on that stat. This is perfect since Yelan wants high ER anyway to spam her Burst as often as possible. If you\u2019re not running Emblem, you can use a 2-piece HP% and 2-piece Hydro DMG set for more balanced support and damage. Stat priorities should focus on HP% (her damage scales with HP), Hydro DMG Bonus on the goblet, and Crit Rate or Crit DMG on the circlet depending on your weapon. Substats like Energy Recharge, Crit, and more HP% are very valuable. Weapon-wise, Yelan\u2019s best weapon is her signature bow, *Aqua Simulacra*. It boosts Crit DMG and increases her max HP and damage dealt when near enemies, which aligns perfectly with her playstyle. However, she has strong alternatives at every rarity. *Favonius Warbow* is a fantastic 4-star support option that helps recharge energy for your whole team. *The Stringless* increases her skill and burst damage, making it great for raw damage output. *Sacrificial Bow* can also work if you want to double-cast her Elemental Skill. Even *Recurve Bow*, a 3-star bow with HP%, can work early on to boost her damage scaling. Yelan\u2019s constellations are very impactful. C1 lets her skill hold two charges, increasing her energy generation and mobility. C2 significantly boosts her team's damage during her Burst. C4 enhances party HP scaling, and her C6 massively boosts her on-field DPS by allowing her to fire an additional powered-up attack during her Burst period. However, she is already an incredibly strong unit at C0, and most players don\u2019t need constellations to get the most out of her. Yelan is incredibly flexible when it comes to teams. She thrives in Vaporize teams with Pyro characters like Hu Tao, Yoimiya, or Diluc. Her Burst consistently applies Hydro, letting Pyro characters trigger Vaporize for massive damage. She also works well in Freeze teams with Cryo units or in Electro-Charged teams with Electro supports like Raiden Shogun, Fischl, or Beidou. Her synergy with Xingqiu is notable too\u2014they can be run together for even stronger Hydro application, especially in double-Hydro teams that boost max HP scaling for both. In essence, Yelan is one of the strongest and most stylish sub-DPS characters in *Genshin Impact*. Her fast, fluid movement, consistent Hydro application, and massive burst damage make her an asset to nearly any team composition. She\u2019s perfect for players who enjoy weaving in and out of combat, creating high-damage setups from the sidelines, and playing the game with a mix of speed, precision, and flair. Whether you're tackling bosses or pushing Spiral Abyss, Yelan brings lethal elegance to every encounter."}, {"question": "Tell me about Dehya", "answer": "Dehya is a 5-star Pyro claymore user from Sumeru, known for her fierce sense of justice, unwavering loyalty, and protective heart. As a mercenary of the Eremites and a bodyguard by profession, Dehya fights not just for herself, but to shield others\u2014a trait that reflects strongly in her unique and complex playstyle. While her initial reception was mixed due to her unconventional mechanics and scaling, Dehya has since proven to be a valuable asset in teams that need a durable off-field presence and a source of passive damage mitigation. At the core of Dehya\u2019s kit is her Elemental Skill, *Molten Inferno*. When activated, Dehya slams the ground and creates a *Fiery Sanctum* field. While this field is active, enemies inside will be periodically hit with coordinated Pyro attacks when characters take damage or when Dehya uses her Burst. More importantly, Dehya partially absorbs incoming damage dealt to active characters within the field, and stores it for herself, preventing interruptions and enhancing survivability for characters like Hu Tao or Cyno who benefit from uninterrupted attacks. This makes her one of the few characters who can act as a semi-tank or damage sponge in teams that are otherwise squishy. Dehya\u2019s Elemental Burst, *The Lioness' Bite*, turns her into a flame-fueled brawler. She enters a combat stance and unleashes a barrage of Pyro-infused punches and kicks over a short duration, with her damage scaling off her ATK and HP. While this looks like a main DPS ability, the scaling and speed of the punches aren\u2019t as explosive as other burst-DPS characters. As a result, she\u2019s more effective as an off-field bruiser and enabler rather than a high-damage carry. That said, her Burst still contributes to consistent Pyro damage, and with the right support, she can dish out respectable numbers\u2014especially at higher constellations. Building Dehya requires a focus on both survivability and damage. Her best artifact set is typically the 4-piece *Emblem of Severed Fate*, which increases her Energy Recharge and boosts her Burst damage. If you\u2019re using her more as a support or tanky off-field unit, 2-piece sets like *Tenacity of the Millelith* and *Crimson Witch of Flames* can provide a mix of HP and Pyro DMG bonuses. As for stats, HP% is key on sands (since it enhances both her tanking and some of her damage), with Pyro DMG Bonus on the goblet, and Crit Rate or Crit DMG on the circlet depending on her weapon. Energy Recharge is also important to keep her Burst uptime consistent. Dehya\u2019s best weapons vary depending on her role. Her signature 5-star weapon, *Beacon of the Reed Sea*, increases her Crit Rate and provides ATK and HP bonuses when she takes or prevents damage\u2014perfectly tailored to her playstyle. Other great options include *Wolf\u2019s Gravestone* for ATK buffs, *Serpent Spine* (if you can manage the downside), or *Redhorn Stonethresher* for crit-heavy builds. For 4-star options, *Mailed Flower* or *Akuoumaru* can be used for hybrid damage setups, while *Favonius Greatsword* offers support utility and energy generation. Her constellations gradually transform her into a more viable DPS. C1 allows her Elemental Skill to reposition the Fiery Sanctum without downtime, improving uptime and flexibility. C2 gives her passive healing based on her max HP after taking damage\u2014adding even more sustain. Her C4 boosts her Burst\u2019s crit rate, and her C6 gives her rapid attacks during her Burst that scale heavily with HP, massively improving her potential as a main DPS. While she functions well at C0 for off-field support and damage mitigation, she becomes a much more dangerous and fluid fighter at higher constellations. Dehya synergizes well with characters who need protection or uninterrupted field time. She is especially good in Burgeon teams (Pyro + Dendro + Hydro), where her passive Pyro application and resistance to interruption can stabilize what is otherwise a high-risk comp. She also supports hypercarries like Cyno or Xiao, reducing the need for shielding and allowing them to focus on damage. While her Pyro application is not fast enough for Vape-focused teams, she still brings solid utility and moderate damage to teams that appreciate durability and flexibility. In summary, Dehya is a unique character who breaks the mold of traditional claymore users. She\u2019s not about massive crits or explosive nukes, but rather about being the steady, relentless flame on your team\u2014protecting allies, applying Pyro over time, and offering a rare blend of tanking and support. Her value shines most in challenging domains or long fights where survival matters just as much as damage. For players who enjoy a resilient, loyal character who can hold the line and strike back fiercely, Dehya brings both heart and heat to any team."}, {"question": "Tell me about Xilonen", "answer": "Xilonen is a 5-star Geo sword user from the fiery and ancient land of Natlan, introduced as part of Genshin Impact's expanding storyline. As a character, Xilonen stands out for her deep connection to tradition and balance, embodying themes of healing, protection, and endurance. Her name, likely inspired by the Aztec goddess of sustenance, reflects her core role in combat\u2014providing stability and steady support to her allies while reinforcing their strength with the immovable power of Geo. In terms of gameplay, Xilonen is a hybrid support and buffer whose abilities revolve around creating resilient shields and gradually healing her party while simultaneously boosting their damage under certain conditions. Her **Elemental Skill**, *Stoneheart Bloom*, summons a blossoming Geo structure that pulses with energy. This construct not only generates a shield for the active character but also periodically emits a wave of Geo damage that scales off Xilonen\u2019s max HP. These pulses heal nearby allies over time, giving her an incredible amount of passive utility during prolonged fights. Her shield isn\u2019t the strongest in the game compared to units like Zhongli, but what makes Xilonen special is how her healing is tied into her Geo construct, enabling her to sustain a team quietly and efficiently. Her **Elemental Burst**, *Earth\u2019s Embrace*, is a powerful wide-area Geo explosion that not only deals solid burst damage but also imbues party members with a buff that increases resistance to interruption and enhances their DEF-to-DMG conversion if applicable. This makes her a unique partner to characters like Noelle or Itto, who benefit from boosted DEF stats. The Burst also has a healing-over-time effect that scales with her HP, reinforcing her status as a durable and reliable backbone to any team that needs a mix of healing, shielding, and support buffs. For her **artifact sets**, Xilonen works beautifully with the 4-piece *Tenacity of the Millelith* for boosting ATK and shielding efficiency, or a 4-piece *Maiden Beloved* if you want to focus more on her healing. Alternatively, a 2-piece combination of HP% sets and Geo DMG Bonus can work for mixed utility. Her best stats focus on HP% for both sustain and damage scaling, along with Energy Recharge to keep her Burst ready, and Healing Bonus on her circlet if you want her to double down on party sustain. When it comes to **weapons**, Xilonen benefits most from swords that increase HP or Energy Recharge. Her best-in-slot is likely a new 5-star sword designed around her that boosts both her healing and shield strength. However, more accessible options like *Favonius Sword* or *Sacrificial Sword* are fantastic for team energy generation. For more HP scaling, *Freedom-Sworn* can be a surprising pick if the passive synergizes with her role in a support-heavy comp. Xilonen\u2019s **constellations** further enhance her hybrid playstyle. Early constellations reduce cooldowns and boost healing efficiency, while later ones improve her shield strength and even give her team-wide buffs that scale with her HP or DEF. Her final constellation turns her Geo construct into a second damage source that mirrors her Burst\u2019s buff effects, allowing for more dynamic support during active rotations. Team-wise, Xilonen fits naturally into mono-Geo teams or hybrid comps where durability is essential. She\u2019s an ideal partner for **Itto**, **Albedo**, **Noelle**, or even characters like **Navia** who appreciate off-field Geo resonance and a safety net. Her healing and steady buffs also make her useful in Freeze teams or Burgeon comps that need someone to stabilize the chaos. In essence, Xilonen is a slow-burning powerhouse\u2014a character who doesn\u2019t dominate the field with flashy damage but provides a quiet, essential rhythm to your team\u2019s survival and output. She\u2019s perfect for players who enjoy tactical team composition and love having a solid, dependable unit who keeps everyone alive and empowered. Whether you\u2019re diving into long Abyss fights or exploring the rugged terrain of Natlan, Xilonen is the heart that beats beneath the stone, quietly ensuring your victory."}, {"question": "Tell me about Citlali", "answer": "Citlali is a 5-star Cryo catalyst user hailing from Natlan, often referred to with reverence as \u201cGranny Itztli\u201d due to her role as a spiritual guide and shaman of the region\u2019s mysterious Masters of the Night-Wind. Despite her age and calm demeanor, Citlali is a formidable wielder of Cryo, channeling her elemental powers through ancient rituals and spiritual invocations. She\u2019s deeply tied to tradition, known for her wisdom, and often keeps to herself in her quiet mountain home, where she enjoys a surprising pastime\u2014reading light novels. This duality between her ancient role and personal quirks makes her a particularly charming and nuanced character in Genshin Impact\u2019s ever-expanding roster. In combat, Citlali functions primarily as a support unit with powerful Cryo application and unique buffs tailored for reaction-based teams. Her Elemental Skill summons an Opal Shield\u2014a construct that protects allies while continuously applying Cryo in a small area. Enemies caught within it suffer reduced resistance to Pyro and Hydro, making her an exceptional enabler in both Melt and Freeze team comps. The shield itself isn't the toughest compared to units like Diona or Layla, but its strength lies in the way it creates a safe zone for her allies while subtly boosting the team\u2019s elemental potential. Her Elemental Burst is equally distinctive. She calls forth a spirit named Itzpapa, which hovers near the active character, applying Cryo to enemies and boosting the Elemental Mastery of shielded allies. This combination of steady Cryo application and reaction amplification means Citlali thrives best when paired with characters who can trigger strong elemental combos. Building Citlali effectively means leaning into her supportive nature. Her abilities scale well with Elemental Mastery and benefit from having good Energy Recharge, especially to keep her Burst active regularly. Artifacts that increase Cryo damage or Elemental Mastery\u2014like the Scroll of the Hero of Cinder City\u2014suit her well. Alternatively, a mix of sets that improve her shielding and reaction output can work depending on your team needs. For main stats, Elemental Mastery on the sands and circlet can significantly enhance the damage from reactions like Melt and Freeze, while a Cryo Damage Bonus goblet ensures her attacks don\u2019t fall off in damage. Weapons like *Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers* provide amazing team-wide ATK boosts, and other catalysts that enhance EM or energy generation also complement her role beautifully. Citlali works best when placed in teams that capitalize on the elemental reactions she enables so effortlessly. Melt teams with Pyro carries such as Diluc or Hu Tao benefit from her ability to keep enemies Cryo-infused and vulnerable. Freeze teams that include Hydro characters like Mona or Kokomi appreciate the consistency and range of her Cryo application. Because her shield is always working in the background and her Cryo pulses are frequent, she also fits in teams that need off-field support while the main DPS shines uninterrupted. Her healing is subtle and indirect\u2014more spiritual than clinical\u2014but she can stabilize fights with surprising effectiveness. As she ascends and unlocks constellations, Citlali grows stronger in her ability to maintain field presence and sustain her buffs. Her first constellation extends the duration of her summoned spirit, giving her team longer windows to benefit from Elemental Mastery boosts and Cryo damage. By the time she reaches her final constellation, she offers significant team-wide bonuses that make her an essential pick for those who rely heavily on elemental reaction chains. Overall, Citlali is a uniquely spiritual support unit with strong thematic design and gameplay mechanics that emphasize harmony and balance. She\u2019s not the flashy DPS who dominates with raw numbers, but instead the quiet, ever-present force guiding the team\u2019s reactions, sustaining their energy, and protecting them with wisdom drawn from centuries of tradition. For players who enjoy synergistic team play and want a support unit that feels both mystical and meaningful, Citlali is a perfect fit\u2014graceful, insightful, and always watching with the calm gaze of the stars."}, {"question": "Tell me about Amber", "answer": "Amber is one of the earliest characters you'll meet in Genshin Impact, and she holds a special place in the hearts of many players\u2014not just because she's the only Outrider of the Knights of Favonius, but also because she represents the cheerful spirit of Mondstadt. She's a 4-star Pyro bow user, and although she may not be the most meta-breaking unit in the game, she\u2019s incredibly useful in early gameplay and has a very straightforward, beginner-friendly kit that makes her a good character for learning core combat mechanics like elemental reactions, aiming with bows, and controlling battlefield positioning. In combat, Amber plays a supportive and utility role with some elements of crowd control. Her Elemental Skill, *Explosive Puppet*, summons her companion Baron Bunny, a decoy that taunts enemies and then explodes after a short delay, dealing Pyro damage in a small area. It\u2019s great for distracting enemies in early-game fights and allows you to reposition or line up attacks while enemies are focused on the puppet. This skill gets stronger with Amber\u2019s HP, though in practice, it\u2019s often used more for its taunting utility than for damage. Her Elemental Burst, *Fiery Rain*, fires a shower of flaming arrows into the air that rains down in an area, dealing continuous Pyro damage. It's especially useful when fighting groups of enemies or setting up Pyro reactions like Overloaded or Vaporize, especially when paired with Hydro or Electro characters. Amber\u2019s normal attacks and charged shots also play a significant role in her playstyle. As a bow user, she can charge her shots to apply Pyro directly to enemies, which makes her one of the first tools you get for solving environmental puzzles and lighting torches in the open world. In combat, her charged shots can also be used to trigger reactions with Cryo or Electro applications from other characters, letting you experiment with reaction mechanics early on. While her damage scaling doesn\u2019t hold up as well in late-game content, creative players can still make her viable through strategic builds. For artifacts, newer players can start her off with sets like *Instructor* to boost Elemental Mastery or *Noblesse Oblige* to enhance her Burst utility. Eventually, sets like *Emblem of Severed Fate* or *Wanderer\u2019s Troupe* can provide more consistent damage, especially if you\u2019re leaning into her Burst or charged shot playstyle. For stats, aim for Energy Recharge and Pyro Damage Bonus to help her get her Burst up more often and increase its impact. In terms of weapons, she works well with bows that offer Energy Recharge like *Favonius Warbow*, or even *The Stringless*, which increases Elemental Skill and Burst damage. Amber\u2019s constellations bring out more of her supportive side. Her first constellation lets you manually detonate Baron Bunny by shooting it in the foot, giving you more control over its effect. Later constellations boost her attack speed and increase her overall damage potential. While her constellations don\u2019t turn her into a top-tier DPS, they do make her more enjoyable and flexible to play. What makes Amber special isn\u2019t just her combat utility, but her personality and charm. She\u2019s energetic, dependable, and genuinely cares about the people of Mondstadt. Her role as an Outrider is taken seriously\u2014even when others treat it like a novelty\u2014and she often goes out of her way to help both travelers and townsfolk alike. Amber also plays a key narrative role in the early chapters of the Archon Quest, making her the first friendly face many players grow attached to. All in all, Amber is a lovable and underrated character whose value lies not only in what she can do in combat but in how approachable and versatile she is for new players. She teaches you the basics of the game, helps you solve puzzles, and shows you what it means to be a hero in Mondstadt\u2014someone who helps others with a smile, no matter the odds."}, {"question": "Tell me about Bennet", "answer": "Bennett is one of Genshin Impact\u2019s most beloved and universally respected 4-star characters, known for his incredible support capabilities and upbeat, adventurous personality. He wields a sword and harnesses the Pyro element, and despite the bad luck that seems to follow him wherever he goes, he remains an indispensable member of many top-tier team compositions. While he may be portrayed as a walking magnet for mishaps in the game\u2019s story, on the battlefield, Bennett is anything but unlucky\u2014he\u2019s one of the most powerful support units in the game, with a kit that amplifies team performance in almost every way. Bennett\u2019s strength lies in his Elemental Burst, *Fantastic Voyage*, which creates a circular field that simultaneously heals and boosts the attack of characters within its radius. The healing is based on his max HP, making it very reliable for keeping your team alive, while the attack bonus scales off his base attack (which includes his weapon and leveling bonuses, but not artifacts). This means that giving him a high-base-attack sword\u2014like *Aquila Favonia* or *Skyward Blade*\u2014instantly elevates his supportive potential. Once activated, the field heals any character inside it up to 70% HP and provides a massive attack buff to characters standing within its area. That single skill is what makes Bennett a staple across a huge variety of team comps. His Elemental Skill, *Passion Overload*, is a Pyro-infused sword strike that can be tapped or held for different effects. The tap version is quick and efficient for generating energy and applying Pyro, while the longer holds deal more damage but also knock Bennett back if overcharged\u2014playing into his chaotic, unlucky theme. While this skill isn't the primary reason people use him, it's still a reliable way to apply Pyro for reactions like Vaporize, Melt, or Overload, and it's a good energy-generating ability to fuel his Burst. When building Bennett, the most important stats depend on your intended use. Most players build him as a pure support, focusing on Energy Recharge (to keep his Burst ready often), HP% (for more effective healing), and base attack (via a strong weapon) to maximize his buffing capabilities. His best artifact set for general support is the 4-piece *Noblesse Oblige*, which increases Burst damage and gives your entire team an attack boost after using his Elemental Burst. Alternatively, if you want him to also apply Pyro more often or act as a sub-DPS, sets like *Crimson Witch of Flames* or *Emblem of Severed Fate* can also be strong, though his support version remains the most popular and efficient. Bennett\u2019s constellations are also incredibly impactful. His first constellation removes the HP restriction from his Burst\u2019s attack buff, allowing the buff to apply regardless of how much health your characters have. This makes a huge difference in real-world gameplay, as you won\u2019t need to worry about being above 70% HP to get the boost. His C4 increases weapon damage within the Burst field, and while his C6 is controversial (as it infuses characters with Pyro if they\u2019re using melee weapons), it can be both a blessing and a curse depending on team composition. For non-physical DPS like Eula, C6 can interfere, but for characters like Diluc or Klee, it\u2019s a solid power-up. In terms of team synergy, Bennett fits in almost any comp. He\u2019s perfect in Pyro teams, of course, but he also thrives in reaction-based teams like Vaporize with Xingqiu or Freeze/Melt with Ganyu. Even non-reaction-based teams benefit from his healing and attack boost. He\u2019s the kind of unit that multiplies your team\u2019s strength by enabling your main DPS to reach their full potential\u2014whether it's Hu Tao, Ayaka, Raiden, or even newer characters from regions like Fontaine or Natlan. Bennett\u2019s personality also plays a huge part in his popularity. Despite being plagued by constant misfortune, he never lets it get him down. He leads the \u201cBenny\u2019s Adventure Team,\u201d though all his team members have mysteriously left due to his unlucky aura. Still, he remains ever-hopeful, kindhearted, and determined to bring joy and heroism to the people of Mondstadt. His loyalty, positivity, and tireless efforts to help others\u2014even when things don\u2019t go his way\u2014make him a fan favorite beyond just gameplay. In the end, Bennett represents the best kind of Genshin character: someone who may seem modest at first glance, but with just a little investment and understanding, reveals himself to be one of the most powerful and supportive allies you can have. Whether you\u2019re a beginner needing healing and attack boosts, or an Abyss veteran optimizing rotations and damage windows, Bennett is always a reliable\u2014and lucky\u2014choice."}, {"question": "Tell me about Diluc", "answer": "Diluc is a 5-star Pyro claymore user from Mondstadt who once stood at the pinnacle of DPS characters in Genshin Impact and still remains a solid, accessible choice for players who enjoy straightforward, hard-hitting melee combat. His playstyle is elegant and efficient\u2014he flows seamlessly between normal attacks, Elemental Skills, and Bursts, all while dishing out consistent Pyro damage that makes him a prime candidate for powerful elemental reactions. Diluc is an exceptional choice for players who prefer a main DPS role that doesn\u2019t rely on overly complex mechanics but still brings satisfying damage, especially when paired with proper supports. His Elemental Skill, *Searing Onslaught*, is the core of his kit. It\u2019s a three-part Pyro slash combo, where each strike must be used within a short window of the last to chain the combo. Each hit deals Pyro damage and can independently trigger elemental reactions, allowing for Melt or Vaporize multiple times in a single rotation. This gives Diluc a unique advantage when played with characters that provide rapid off-field Hydro or Cryo applications. While the timing of the combo is important to maintain its flow, the skill is beginner-friendly and becomes second nature quickly. Diluc\u2019s Elemental Burst, *Dawn*, unleashes a massive flame phoenix that soars forward, dealing a burst of AoE Pyro damage and applying Pyro to enemies it hits. More importantly, it imbues his claymore with Pyro for 8 seconds, turning all of his normal and charged attacks into Pyro damage. This infusion is a key part of his playstyle, as it ensures he can consistently trigger elemental reactions after his Burst. It also gives him excellent synergy with off-field reaction enablers, as he continues to apply Pyro without relying on his skill cooldown. In terms of artifacts, Diluc\u2019s best-in-slot set is the **4-piece Crimson Witch of Flames**, which increases Pyro damage and reaction bonuses. This set not only boosts his raw Pyro damage, but also enhances the effectiveness of Vaporize and Melt\u2014both of which he triggers frequently. If a full Crimson Witch set isn\u2019t available, a viable alternative is a **2-piece Crimson Witch + 2-piece Gladiator\u2019s Finale** or **2-piece ATK% sets**. For main stats, an **ATK% Sands**, **Pyro DMG Bonus Goblet**, and **CRIT Rate or CRIT DMG Circlet** (depending on weapon and substats) are standard. His substats should prioritize **CRIT Rate**, **CRIT DMG**, **ATK%**, and **Energy Recharge**. Diluc\u2019s weapon choices are straightforward: he benefits the most from high base attack and critical stats. His best weapon is **Wolf\u2019s Gravestone**, which offers a massive ATK boost for the whole party when hitting low-health enemies. **Redhorn Stonethresher** can also be used, though it favors DEF-scaling characters more, and **Serpent Spine** is an excellent battle pass option, offering great crit stats at the cost of some survivability. **Skyward Pride** and **The Unforged** are also strong 5-star contenders. For free-to-play players, **Prototype Archaic** offers solid performance thanks to its burst AoE passive and decent base stats. In team compositions, Diluc shines brightest when paired with characters that enable **Melt** or **Vaporize** reactions. **Xingqiu** is one of his best partners\u2014his Elemental Skill and Burst apply consistent Hydro, allowing Diluc to Vaporize nearly every swing. Cryo units like **Kaeya**, **Rosaria**, or **Layla** work well for Melt, with off-field Cryo application to amplify his Pyro strikes. **Bennett** is another exceptional teammate\u2014his Burst provides both healing and a massive ATK boost, and the two of them form a strong Mono Pyro core. **Zhongli** or **Diona** can offer shielding to allow Diluc to attack uninterrupted. Even **Sucrose** or **Kazuha** can be excellent choices to Swirl Pyro and provide Elemental Mastery boosts. Diluc\u2019s constellations are decent, though not necessary for him to be effective. His **C1** removes the cooldown between the slashes of *Searing Onslaught*, making his combos smoother and faster. **C2** increases the duration of his Pyro infusion from his Burst by 4 seconds, extending his reaction window. **C4** increases the damage of his *Searing Onslaught* combo when used in quick succession. His **C6** allows his *Searing Onslaught* to increase the damage of subsequent hits, significantly boosting his overall DPS. While Diluc is fully functional at C0 and has been used that way by many players for years, his constellations refine his experience and improve his output in meaningful ways. From a narrative standpoint, Diluc is a stoic protector of Mondstadt who works in the shadows. As the owner of Dawn Winery and former Knight of Favonius, he distances himself from the institution he once served, believing they\u2019ve become too bureaucratic and ineffective. Instead, he patrols the city at night as the mysterious Darknight Hero, taking justice into his own hands. His cold exterior hides a deep sense of justice and responsibility, and his disdain for weakness is driven more by personal tragedy than arrogance. In short, Diluc is a timeless main DPS who brings consistent Pyro application, strong scaling, and a beautiful, fluid kit that makes combat feel fast and impactful. He may not be the flashiest or most mechanically complex DPS in the modern roster, but his reliability, ease of use, and high reaction synergy continue to make him a relevant and satisfying choice for both new and veteran players. Whether you\u2019re blazing through Mondstadt\u2019s story or cleaving through bosses, Diluc\u2019s unyielding flame will never let you down."}, {"question": "Tell me about Hu tao", "answer": "Hu Tao is a 5-star Pyro polearm user from Liyue who serves as the 77th Director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. Despite her occupation and her love for the spooky and macabre, she\u2019s cheerful, playful, and unpredictable\u2014with a mischievous charm that masks a deeply philosophical and compassionate outlook on life and death. In combat, Hu Tao is a powerhouse single-target main DPS with one of the highest damage ceilings in the game, thanks to her HP-scaling kit, hard-hitting Pyro attacks, and access to extremely potent elemental reactions like Vaporize. Her playstyle revolves around carefully managing her health to maintain maximum damage output. Hu Tao\u2019s Elemental Skill, **Guide to Afterlife**, is at the core of her kit. When activated, it consumes a portion of her HP to enter the Paramita Papilio state, converting her normal and charged attacks into Pyro damage and significantly increasing her attack based on her max HP. This transformation lasts for 9 seconds, during which she becomes a fast-paced Pyro melee attacker. It\u2019s critical to note that Hu Tao does *more* damage when she\u2019s under 50% HP, so her kit naturally encourages low-HP play. This introduces a high-risk, high-reward dynamic that makes her exciting to use but requires awareness and timing. Her **charged attacks** while in the Paramita state are incredibly important, as they are her main damage source. Most players weave in normal attacks and cancel her charged attack animation using jump or dash cancels to maximize DPS and stamina efficiency. Hu Tao\u2019s **Elemental Burst**, *Spirit Soother*, is an AoE Pyro strike that heals her based on how many enemies are hit and her max HP. It also deals bonus damage if her HP is below 50% when she uses it. The Burst serves both as an emergency heal and a finishing blow, and good Hu Tao players time it strategically at the end of a combo rotation. Hu Tao\u2019s best team comps involve triggering **Vaporize** reactions, where her Pyro damage reacts with Hydro to deal double damage. Because of this, **Xingqiu** is her premier partner\u2014his Elemental Skill and Burst apply Hydro off-field consistently with each of Hu Tao\u2019s fast melee strikes, enabling nearly every charged attack to Vaporize. **Yelan** performs a similar role and can even be paired with Xingqiu for double Hydro synergy, further increasing her damage. **Zhongli** is another top-tier support for Hu Tao: his shield offers excellent interruption resistance and defense, and the resistance shred from his pillar helps Hu Tao deal even more damage while staying safe at low HP. Artifact-wise, Hu Tao\u2019s best set is the **4-piece Crimson Witch of Flames**, which increases both her Pyro damage and the power of her elemental reactions. This synergizes perfectly with her Vaporize-centric gameplay and enhances all aspects of her kit. For main stats, she benefits most from **HP% or ATK% Sands**, **Pyro Damage Bonus Goblet**, and **CRIT Rate or CRIT Damage Circlet**, depending on the weapon and substats. Her substats should prioritize **CRIT Rate**, **CRIT Damage**, **HP%**, and **Elemental Mastery** for reaction amplification. Weapon-wise, her signature 5-star weapon, **Staff of Homa**, is tailor-made for her. It increases her HP, boosts CRIT Damage, and gives a huge attack bonus when her HP is low\u2014perfectly complementing her low-HP playstyle. Other excellent 5-star options include **Primordial Jade Winged-Spear** and **Deathmatch** (a strong 4-star option from the battle pass), both of which provide useful crit stats. **Dragon\u2019s Bane**, a 4-star polearm, is also a fantastic option due to its Elemental Mastery bonus and damage boost against enemies affected by Hydro or Pyro\u2014again perfect for her reaction-based playstyle. Her constellations further amplify her power. **C1** removes the stamina cost of her charged attacks during her Elemental Skill, making animation cancels more efficient and sustainable. **C2** increases her Blood Blossom damage (a secondary Pyro effect applied by her charged attacks). Her **C4** increases her team\u2019s CRIT Rate when enemies affected by her Blood Blossom are defeated. Her **C6** is game-changing\u2014it allows her to enter Paramita Papilio mode when she falls below 25% HP or takes a lethal hit, essentially granting her a \u201csecond wind\u201d and a huge boost in survivability and power. While Hu Tao is already very strong at C0, her constellations\u2014especially C1 and C6\u2014can significantly enhance her fluidity and safety. Hu Tao\u2019s charm extends far beyond combat. As a character, she\u2019s known for her quirky poems, love for pranks, and philosophical musings about death and the afterlife. She\u2019s eccentric but genuine, and beneath the fun exterior is a character who takes her duties very seriously. She believes death should be respected and understood rather than feared, and she helps others cope with grief and loss through her work at the funeral parlor. Her lore and personality make her a standout figure in Liyue and one of the most layered characters in the game. In short, Hu Tao is a Pyro DPS specialist with immense single-target burst damage, top-tier reaction potential, and a distinctive low-HP risk-reward mechanic. With proper supports and timing, she can melt through high-end content and bosses with ease. She\u2019s a favorite for players who enjoy fast-paced gameplay with a technical edge, and her personality adds both humor and depth to any party she\u2019s in. Whether you\u2019re just starting out or a seasoned Genshin veteran, Hu Tao rewards skill and smart play with explosive results."}, {"question": "Tell me about Yanfie", "answer": "Yanfei is a 4-star Pyro catalyst user from Liyue, known for her sharp legal mind and confident charm. As a half-illuminated beast\u2014born of an adeptus parent and a mortal\u2014she possesses both great wisdom and strong Pyro abilities. In battle, she serves as a ranged main DPS or sub-DPS who dishes out powerful Pyro attacks using her charged shots, making her ideal for players who enjoy spellcaster-style characters with clean, rhythmic damage output. Her kit is centered around building up *Scarlet Seals* to enhance her charged attacks, making her gameplay a mix of careful positioning, fast normal attack strings, and well-timed Pyro bursts. Yanfei\u2019s combat loop begins with her **normal attacks**, which shoot fireballs at enemies and generate *Scarlet Seals*\u2014up to three at a time. Each seal decreases the stamina cost of her charged attack and boosts its damage, encouraging players to build up seals and then release a charged attack for a big Pyro burst. This back-and-forth rhythm is her signature playstyle: build, then burn. Her **Elemental Skill**, *Signed Edict*, deals AoE Pyro damage and instantly grants the maximum number of Scarlet Seals, letting her go right into a powerful charged attack. It also helps with energy generation and allows for consistent Pyro application, especially useful when triggering reactions like Vaporize. Her **Elemental Burst**, *Done Deal*, is where her damage spikes significantly. Upon activation, it deals AoE Pyro damage and grants her a buff that increases the damage of her charged attacks while granting a fresh set of Scarlet Seals. This burst is best used to open up a powerful string of charged attacks, and with proper rotation, it can be used alongside her Skill to maintain seal uptime and optimize DPS. Yanfei\u2019s gameplay thrives on this cycling rhythm\u2014Skill, charged attack, Burst, repeat\u2014and rewards players who are good at timing their Pyro reactions and managing stamina efficiently. For artifacts, Yanfei is best built with either a **4-piece Crimson Witch of Flames** for maximum Pyro and reaction damage, or **2-piece Crimson Witch + 2-piece Gladiator\u2019s Finale** or **ATK% set** if you're earlier in the game or waiting on better Crimson pieces. Her best artifact stats are **ATK% Sands**, **Pyro DMG Bonus Goblet**, and **CRIT Rate or CRIT DMG Circlet**, depending on your weapon choice. Substats like **CRIT**, **ATK%**, and **Elemental Mastery** (for reaction damage) all contribute greatly to her output, especially when paired with Hydro teammates for Vaporize setups. As for weapons, Yanfei benefits most from catalysts that boost her ATK or CRIT stats. The 5-star **Lost Prayer to the Sacred Winds** is great for her due to its CRIT Rate and elemental damage boost over time. **Solar Pearl** from the battle pass is a very strong 4-star option, boosting both her normal and charged attacks, which are key to her kit. **The Widsith** offers random but powerful buffs that can skyrocket her damage temporarily, especially in burst-focused teams. For F2P players, **Mappa Mare** is a solid choice\u2014it grants Elemental Mastery and increases elemental damage upon reactions, which pairs nicely with a Vaporize build. Team-wise, Yanfei works well in **Vaporize-focused teams** where she applies Pyro rapidly and reacts with off-field Hydro characters like **Xingqiu** or **Yelan**. This massively increases the damage of her charged attacks. **Bennett** is also a powerful support for her\u2014his ATK buff and healing allow Yanfei to freely go on the offensive while staying topped up. **Zhongli** provides a shield that helps Yanfei remain uninterrupted during her charging animations, as she\u2019s a catalyst user with no natural interruption resistance. **Sucrose** or **Kazuha** can also amplify her damage through elemental resistance shred and Swirl reactions. Yanfei\u2019s constellations can boost her performance, particularly if you want to make her your main DPS. **C1** increases her charged attack CRIT Rate when she has max Scarlet Seals, helping her consistency. **C2** extends the duration of her Burst\u2019s buff, letting her deal increased damage for longer. **C4** increases her energy regeneration and shields her slightly when below 50% HP. Her **C6** is a game-changer, granting her a shield after using her charged attack and making her much more self-sufficient in combat. While she works fine at C0, her constellations\u2014especially C1 and C6\u2014make her feel smoother and more reliable in extended fights. As a character, Yanfei brings a unique flavor to Liyue\u2019s cast. Despite her adepti heritage, she\u2019s fully integrated into human society and pursues a civilian life as a legal advisor. She\u2019s intelligent, talkative, and pragmatic, and she often represents people in legal disputes, advocating for fairness with firm conviction. Unlike many other adepti who live in seclusion or resist modern life, Yanfei embraces it with enthusiasm and embodies a bridge between the mystical and the mundane. Her playful, fiery personality matches her Pyro element perfectly, and she adds warmth and sass to any party. In summary, Yanfei is a stylish Pyro catalyst user with a strong charged attack playstyle, ideal for players who enjoy casting powerful ranged bursts while weaving elemental reactions into their rotation. Her accessible kit, excellent synergy with Hydro characters, and smooth scaling make her an excellent 4-star main DPS choice\u2014even for higher-level content when built well. Whether you\u2019re burning through hilichurls or laying down the law with a fiery flourish, Yanfei is proof that legal firepower can be just as fierce as any sword or spear."}, {"question": "Tell me about Yoimiya", "answer": "Yoimiya is a 5-star Pyro bow user from Inazuma, known for her cheerful personality and radiant presence as the owner of Naganohara Fireworks. Both on and off the battlefield, she brings a spark of joy and energy. In combat, Yoimiya shines as a single-target, rapid-fire Pyro main DPS who excels in sustained damage rather than burst-heavy rotations. Her gameplay is smooth, fast-paced, and built around her normal attacks being converted into Pyro-infused shots, making her an ideal pick for players who enjoy a ranged character that doesn\u2019t rely heavily on complex mechanics or charged shots. The heart of Yoimiya\u2019s playstyle is her **Elemental Skill**, *Niwabi Fire-Dance*. When activated, her normal attacks become infused with Pyro for a short duration, turning her into a Pyro machine gun. These infused attacks are her main source of damage and can rapidly trigger elemental reactions like **Vaporize** when paired with Hydro, or **Overloaded** with Electro. Yoimiya does not rely on her charged shots at all once the skill is active\u2014she just needs to hold position and fire her normal attacks as quickly as possible. During this state, movement and aim are key, since she doesn\u2019t have auto-tracking like some catalyst users. Yoimiya\u2019s **Elemental Burst**, *Ryuukin Saxifrage*, deals a small AoE Pyro hit and applies an effect called the **Aurous Blaze** on one opponent. When any other party member hits that enemy, the Blaze triggers an explosion that deals Pyro damage. This makes her Burst more supportive and indirect, as it doesn\u2019t benefit her much while she\u2019s on-field but helps her contribute damage while swapped out. It\u2019s not the centerpiece of her kit but adds a nice bit of extra Pyro damage and can be useful for extending her presence in multi-wave fights or bosses with downtime. Her best artifacts are typically the **4-piece Shimenawa\u2019s Reminiscence** set, which greatly boosts her normal attack damage at the cost of energy. This fits her playstyle well, since most of her value comes from her Skill-infused Pyro shots rather than her Burst. Alternatively, a **4-piece Crimson Witch of Flames** set can be used if she\u2019s focusing more on Vaporize reactions, though Shimenawa tends to offer better raw damage output for pure Pyro builds. Ideal main stats are **ATK% Sands**, **Pyro DMG Bonus Goblet**, and **CRIT Rate or CRIT DMG Circlet**, depending on your weapon. Substats should focus on **CRIT**, **ATK%**, and some **Elemental Mastery** if reaction-based. For weapons, Yoimiya\u2019s best-in-slot is her signature bow, **Thundering Pulse**, which gives a massive CRIT DMG bonus and boosts her attack based on how consistently she uses her normal attacks\u2014perfect for her role. Other strong options include **Rust**, a 4-star bow that significantly boosts her normal attack damage, and **Hamayumi**, a craftable bow that synergizes very well with her Skill and Shimenawa set. **Polar Star** and **Aqua Simulacra** can also be used effectively, though their passives may be less consistent on her. For F2P players, **Hamayumi** at high refinement is excellent and can rival even some 5-stars in performance. Yoimiya performs best in **single-target Vaporize teams**, where Hydro characters like **Yelan** or **Xingqiu** provide off-field Hydro application while she dishes out fast Pyro hits. **Yunjin** is a particularly powerful support for her, as Yunjin\u2019s Burst buffs normal attack damage based on her DEF, scaling beautifully with Yoimiya\u2019s playstyle. **Zhongli** also pairs very well with her, providing strong shielding so she can stand still and fire uninterrupted\u2014since movement is more restricted during her attack strings. **Bennett** is another great choice for both healing and a massive ATK buff. **Kazuha** or **Sucrose** can help trigger Swirl, reduce enemy resistance, and boost Elemental Mastery for even stronger reactions. Her constellations enhance her consistency and utility but aren\u2019t required. **C1** gives her a small attack boost after she uses her Skill. **C2** increases the explosion damage of her Burst\u2019s Aurous Blaze effect and allows it to trigger more often. **C4** gives a flat attack boost to all nearby allies when she uses her Skill. Her **C6** is a powerful capstone that adds a 60% chance for an extra Pyro hit on her normal attacks during Fire-Dance, adding a lot of raw damage and increasing her DPS ceiling significantly. While Yoimiya is strong and fun to play at **C0**, her C6 takes her to an elite level, especially in boss fights. Narratively, Yoimiya is one of the most beloved and radiant characters in Inazuma. As the Fireworks Queen, she brings joy to the community and serves as a symbol of hope and celebration during hard times. She\u2019s cheerful, optimistic, and a bit impulsive, but her heart is always in the right place. She believes in helping others, preserving traditions, and lighting up people\u2019s lives with her fireworks and her warmth. Her story quest reveals her kindness, her belief in freedom and expression, and her connection to the people of Inazuma beyond just business. In summary, Yoimiya is a powerful, straightforward, and joyful Pyro main DPS who thrives on rapid normal attacks and single-target precision. She\u2019s best for players who enjoy fast-paced archery with elemental flair, and she rewards good positioning, consistent rhythm, and smart team building. While she may not be the top choice for AoE damage, she absolutely shines in boss fights and single-target content. With the right setup, Yoimiya becomes a fireworks display of Pyro damage that lights up the battlefield as beautifully as she lights up the skies."}, {"question": "Tell me about Xinyan", "answer": "Xinyan is a 4-star Pyro claymore user from Liyue who brings a fiery blend of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll and explosive combat to the battlefield. As Liyue's one and only rockstar, Xinyan's personality is bold, loud, and full of passion\u2014just like her fighting style. She thrives in close-quarters combat and has a unique kit that combines physical and Pyro damage, making her a hybrid character who can be built in a few different ways depending on your team needs. Though she\u2019s often overlooked in the meta, she has a loyal fanbase and can be a fun and effective character when built and played well. Xinyan\u2019s **Elemental Skill**, *Sweeping Fervor*, is central to her playstyle. It performs a quick Pyro slash and summons a shield based on the number of enemies hit. If she hits at least one enemy, she gets a level 1 shield; two enemies gives her a level 2 shield; and hitting three or more gives her the strongest version, which also deals continuous Pyro damage around her. This shield scales with her DEF and provides interruption resistance, making it great for staying aggressive in melee combat. The shield\u2019s Pyro aura at the highest level can also apply Pyro status for reactions like Overloaded, which fits well with Electro or Cryo teammates. Her **Elemental Burst**, *Riff Revolution*, is a flashy spinning claymore attack that deals AoE Pyro damage and ends with a powerful Physical damage explosion. This burst serves as a finisher and is also where her potential as a **physical DPS** becomes more evident. It can be boosted with physical damage buffs, which makes her unique among Pyro characters who usually focus solely on elemental damage. This dual-scaling makes her flexible, but also a little tricky to optimize. Players typically choose to build her either as a Physical DPS who uses her Burst and normal attacks, or as a Pyro support with shield utility and occasional burst damage. Xinyan's artifact sets depend heavily on how you want to use her. For **Physical DPS**, the **4-piece Pale Flame** set is ideal\u2014it boosts her physical damage and gives her an ATK bonus when she uses her skill. You can also run a **2-piece Bloodstained Chivalry + 2-piece Pale Flame** combo. For a **shield support or burst sub-DPS build**, a **4-piece Emblem of Severed Fate** set is excellent for boosting her Burst damage based on Energy Recharge, or you could run **2-piece Noblesse Oblige + 2-piece Pyro DMG/ATK%**. Main stats should be **ATK% or DEF% Sands**, depending on the build, a **Physical DMG Bonus or Pyro DMG Bonus Goblet**, and **CRIT Rate or CRIT DMG Circlet**. Substats should prioritize **CRIT**, **ATK**, and either **Energy Recharge** or **DEF** depending on the focus. For weapons, **Song of Broken Pines** is Xinyan\u2019s best-in-slot for a Physical DPS build, giving her huge physical damage and attack speed. **Serpent Spine** is another top-tier option that boosts her CRIT Rate and damage, especially with consistent shield uptime. **The Unforged** and **Skyward Pride** are decent 5-star options as well. For F2P players, **Prototype Archaic** is a solid choice, and **Whiteblind** can work if you lean into DEF scaling for her shield. For Pyro burst builds, weapons with Energy Recharge like **Favonius Greatsword** can help her get her Burst up more consistently. Xinyan can be slotted into a variety of team comps, but she works best with supports that either enable reactions or boost her survivability. For Physical DPS teams, pairing her with **Superconduct enablers** like **Rosaria**, **Kaeya**, or **Fischl** reduces enemy physical resistance and greatly boosts her output. **Bennett** is a good all-around support who buffs her ATK and helps keep her healed. In Pyro-oriented comps, she can enable **Overloaded** with characters like **Lisa**, **Raiden Shogun**, or **Beidou**, creating big AoE explosions that help clear mobs quickly. She can also be used as a burst support and shielder in quickswap teams, especially when you need some defensive utility. Her constellations help smooth out her playstyle and improve her damage. **C1** reduces opponent physical resistance when her shield is up, which is huge for her physical DPS role. **C2** increases her shield's reliability and gives her more Pyro application. **C3** and **C5** boost her Skill and Burst, while **C4** increases her CRIT Rate when using her Burst. Her **C6** adds an AoE attack every time she does a CRIT with her Burst, making her ultimate even more explosive. While she\u2019s fine at C0, getting a few constellations\u2014especially C1 and C6\u2014makes her feel more consistent and powerful. Outside of battle, Xinyan\u2019s story is just as fiery and bold as her combat style. She\u2019s a free spirit with a deep love for rock music and expression. In a culture like Liyue\u2019s, which leans toward tradition and refinement, she stands out as someone unapologetically loud, unconventional, and full of life. Her music and her presence challenge the status quo, and she inspires those around her to be themselves without fear. She\u2019s passionate about performing, about connecting with people, and about using her music to give a voice to the unheard. In short, Xinyan is a unique and underrated character with a hybrid Pyro-physical kit, strong shielding, and a rockstar attitude. She rewards players who enjoy melee combat and creative team-building, and while she may not dominate the meta, she brings fun, flare, and explosive energy to every fight. With the right build and support, she can burn, smash, and riff her way to victory\u2014true to her style."}, {"question": "Tell me about Kachina", "answer": "Kachina is a 4-star Geo polearm user introduced in the Natlan region of Genshin Impact. Hailing from the Nanatzcayan tribe, Kachina stands out with her fierce determination and a strong sense of duty. Her character is defined by resilience\u2014both thematically and mechanically\u2014which is even reflected in her Ancient Name, 'Uthabiti,' meaning 'Resilience.' As a free unit obtained through the Natlan Archon Quest, Kachina is accessible to all players and offers unique utility with her off-field Geo support capabilities. Her bright, warrior-like personality and the bond with her mechanical companion, Turbo Twirly, make her an endearing and reliable addition to any roster. In combat, Kachina thrives as a sub-DPS and support character, offering consistent off-field damage through her Elemental Skill. When activated, her skill summons Turbo Twirly, a swirling construct that spins rapidly in place, dealing constant Geo damage to nearby enemies. What makes this skill particularly impactful is its synergy with the Crystallize reaction. Whenever Turbo Twirly triggers Crystallize by reacting with other elements, it grants a powerful buff that increases the team\u2019s Elemental and Geo damage. This passive support function makes her an excellent enabler in teams that rely on consistent damage boosts and shields. Her Elemental Burst serves as a finisher, unleashing a powerful Geo explosion that reinforces her Crystallize buff while delivering a burst of damage. This creates a rhythm where Kachina cycles between setting up sustained support and unleashing a timely burst when energy allows. Building Kachina involves a focus on Energy Recharge and defense-based stats, especially if you're leaning into her supportive shield-generating role. Artifacts like Scroll of the Hero of Cinder City are ideal for maximizing her ability to maintain Crystallize uptime while amplifying Geo and elemental damage buffs. Tenacity of the Millelith also complements her style, especially if you're looking to add more teamwide support through increased attack and shield strength. For weapons, her best-in-slot is Footprint of the Rainbow, a polearm that enhances her skill damage and defense scaling. Favonius Lance is also a strong alternative for those seeking a boost in energy generation, allowing her to cycle through her burst more frequently. Team-wise, Kachina shines in compositions that take advantage of the Crystallize reaction. Pairing her with characters who provide frequent elemental application\u2014like Mualani for Hydro or Fischl for Electro\u2014ensures that Turbo Twirly is constantly generating shields and activating her damage buffs. She also fits naturally alongside other Geo units such as Noelle, Albedo, or even the Geo Traveler, thanks to Geo Resonance, which provides increased shield strength and additional damage. Because she can stay off-field while contributing consistent value, she fits well in quickswap teams or even as a reliable flex slot in mono-Geo teams. Kachina\u2019s constellations expand her capabilities as you progress. Her early constellations extend Turbo Twirly\u2019s duration and widen the Crystallize reaction radius, making her more reliable in combat. Later constellations boost her Burst damage and shield utility, with her final constellation providing a second shield when Crystallize is triggered\u2014greatly enhancing team survivability. While she is fully functional at C0, each constellation noticeably sharpens her effectiveness and can be worth pursuing for those who enjoy her playstyle. Lore-wise, Kachina represents a new wave of Natlan characters\u2014young, brave, and full of promise. She is determined to overcome past shortcomings and forge a new legacy for her people, blending ancient traditions with her own innovative spirit. Her friendship with Turbo Twirly symbolizes her creativity and the importance of bonds, even between person and construct. Kachina is more than just a support character\u2014she's a symbol of growth, persistence, and the spark of something new in Natlan's fiery landscape."}, {"question": "Tell me about Kinich", "answer": "Kinich\u2019s playstyle is refreshingly aggressive and mobile, despite him being a Claymore user. Unlike typical heavy-hitting characters who commit to slow, grounded swings, Kinich uses his Elemental Skill to grapple swiftly toward enemies and enter the Nightsoul\u2019s Blessing state. In this state, his playstyle becomes fast-paced and reaction-heavy, with Loop Shots\u2014spinning attacks that deal continuous Dendro damage\u2014forming the core of his sustained damage output. This grants him the ability to close gaps quickly, maintain pressure on enemies, and make full use of Dendro reactions without feeling clunky or restricted. His Elemental Burst complements this rhythm by delivering a wide-area Dendro explosion that capitalizes on the reactions set up by his Skill, making him particularly well-suited for an on-field hypercarry role focused on triggering Burning or Burgeon. In terms of team composition, Kinich thrives alongside characters who enable consistent elemental reactions. Pyro characters are especially synergistic with him, as they help trigger Burning, one of the strongest reaction paths for maximizing his damage. Bennett is a top-tier partner, not only for Pyro application but also because of his healing and flat ATK buff from his Burst. Off-field Pyro units like Xiangling can also keep Pyro on enemies while Kinich remains active. Hydro characters like Kokomi or Xingqiu allow him to access Burgeon, giving more AoE potential. Additionally, Dendro supports like Collei or Nahida reduce his energy demands and provide extra reaction uptime. Because Kinich can act as a reliable solo carry, these supports don\u2019t need to spend much field time, allowing him to take full advantage of his fast-paced, reaction-based kit. His ideal artifact set is the 4-piece Obsidian Codex, which greatly enhances his CRIT Rate and amplifies both his personal damage and his reaction potential. This set is designed to scale with his loop-focused combat style and his reliance on elemental damage. For main stats, stacking Elemental Mastery helps with reaction damage if you're leaning into Burning or Burgeon, while an ATK Sands and CRIT/CRIT DMG on the circlet and goblet are standard for raw personal damage. Substats should focus on CRIT Rate, CRIT DMG, and some Energy Recharge to make sure he has consistent access to his Elemental Burst. If you don\u2019t have access to Obsidian Codex, you can also use a 2-piece combo of Gilded Dreams and Gladiator\u2019s Finale or Deepwood Memories for decent early options. Kinich's constellations enhance his utility and damage ceiling significantly. At Constellation 1, he gains improved energy generation and reduced cooldowns on his grapple, allowing more frequent uptime of his Skill. At Constellation 2, the damage of Loop Shots increases, turning him into a more lethal frontliner. His mid-tier constellations reduce resistance to Dendro on enemies hit by his abilities and provide slight healing or self-sustain, which improves his survivability during aggressive play. At Constellation 6, Kinich reaches his full potential\u2014his Elemental Burst not only gains more damage but also resets the cooldown on his Elemental Skill, allowing him to re-enter Nightsoul\u2019s Blessing immediately. This results in nearly uninterrupted rotations, making him feel fluid, powerful, and consistent. Overall, Kinich plays like a fast-moving warrior who dances around the battlefield, using speed, aggression, and smart team synergy to turn Dendro reactions into a devastating offense. His ability to combine the hard-hitting nature of a Claymore with quick mobility and reaction chaining makes him one of the more unique hypercarries in the game."}, {"question": "Tell me about Chongyun", "answer": "Chongyun is a 4-star Cryo claymore user from Liyue who functions primarily as a sub-DPS or enabler, although he can also fill a main DPS role in certain team comps. He is a calm and disciplined exorcist who carries a noble aura, yet his abilities revolve around an ironic twist\u2014he possesses an innate yang energy that ironically makes him overly susceptible to heat and excitement. In combat, Chongyun uses his cryo vision to great effect, providing powerful area-of-effect Cryo application through his Elemental Skill and Burst. His playstyle is particularly well-suited for players who enjoy a balanced character that can support the team while also contributing strong bursts of damage. Chongyun\u2019s Elemental Skill, Spirit Blade: Chonghua\u2019s Layered Frost, is at the heart of his kit. When used, he strikes the ground with his claymore to create a field of Cryo energy that infuses all melee attacks within it with Cryo damage. This Cryo infusion is particularly useful for enabling reactions like Melt and Freeze, making him a key enabler for characters who rely on Cryo-infused normal attacks, such as Kaeya or even physical characters looking to trigger Frozen or Superconduct reactions. His Elemental Burst, Spirit Blade: Cloud-Parting Star, summons falling blades of Cryo energy that deal a quick burst of AoE damage. While his Burst has decent scaling and hits multiple targets, it\u2019s best used in a rotation as a setup or finisher rather than for sustained damage. In team compositions, Chongyun pairs exceptionally well with Pyro characters to trigger Melt, which offers a significant damage multiplier. For example, teaming him with Xiangling or Bennett allows for consistent Pyro application that, when combined with his Cryo infusion, leads to rapid Melt reactions. He also works well in Freeze teams alongside Hydro units like Xingqiu, Kokomi, or Mona, freezing enemies in place for crowd control and survivability. Additionally, in Superconduct teams\u2014where he\u2019s paired with an Electro character like Fischl or Raiden Shogun\u2014he can reduce enemy physical resistance, enabling physical carries like Eula or Razor to deal more damage. His Cryo field\u2019s infusion also makes him particularly useful in teams that rely on Cryo-charged normal attacks. When it comes to artifacts, Chongyun benefits greatly from the 4-piece Blizzard Strayer set if he's being used as a main or sub-DPS in Freeze teams, as it boosts his CRIT Rate significantly against frozen enemies. For Melt-focused teams, a 2-piece combination of Blizzard Strayer with Gladiator\u2019s Finale or Noblesse Oblige can be strong. You\u2019ll generally want an ATK Sands, Cryo DMG Goblet, and CRIT Rate or CRIT DMG Circlet, depending on your weapon and team setup. His weapon choices include the Sacrificial Greatsword, which lets him use his Skill more frequently\u2014great for Cryo infusion uptime\u2014or alternatives like the Serpent Spine or Prototype Archaic for more direct DPS potential. Chongyun\u2019s constellations add meaningful quality-of-life improvements and damage boosts. His first constellation reduces cooldowns for teammates\u2019 abilities when they\u2019re inside his Cryo field, boosting team rotation speed. At Constellation 2, his Skill creates a summon that attacks enemies after a delay, adding more Cryo application and damage. His later constellations buff his Burst damage and increase attack speed for allies, making him a stronger enabler and sub-DPS. While he functions well at C0, unlocking a few of his constellations can make him a much more efficient and fluid character to use. Chongyun may not always be a front-and-center damage dealer, but he plays an important tactical role in many team compositions, enabling powerful reactions and bringing reliable Cryo application. His infusion field is particularly useful for melee teams that benefit from Cryo, and his Burst can clear waves of enemies or serve as a quick burst of damage. For newer players, he offers an easy-to-understand but versatile Cryo kit, and for more experienced players, he\u2019s a great tool in elemental reaction teams that value strong rotation synergy."}, {"question": "Tell me about Rosaria", "answer": "Rosaria is a 4-star Cryo polearm user from Mondstadt, known for her cold personality, sharp tongue, and somewhat unconventional role as a sister of the Church of Favonius. Despite her rebellious nature, she\u2019s one of the more versatile Cryo characters in Genshin Impact, able to function smoothly as a burst sub-DPS, a Cryo applicator, and even a physical damage support. Her combat style is swift and precise, revolving around quick strikes, rapid repositioning, and reliable elemental application. For players new to Genshin, Rosaria is a solid option to build early, thanks to her flexibility and synergy with multiple team archetypes. Rosaria\u2019s Elemental Skill, *Ravaging Confession*, allows her to dash behind an enemy and strike with a Cryo-infused attack. It deals solid damage, has a short cooldown, and helps her reposition efficiently during combat. This ability is particularly effective for setting up Cryo reactions and can be smoothly integrated into quick-swap rotations. Her Elemental Burst, *Rites of Termination*, is her true standout. When cast, she summons an Ice Lance that strikes enemies and then continues to deal AoE Cryo damage in pulses. This persistent Cryo application makes her excellent in Freeze teams, or in Superconduct setups where consistent Cryo is key. Her Burst also scales well with CRIT stats and becomes a reliable source of both damage and utility. In team compositions, Rosaria works beautifully in Freeze teams alongside Hydro characters like Xingqiu, Mona, or Kokomi. Her Burst keeps enemies frozen, and her passive boosts your team\u2019s CRIT Rate based on her own. This makes her not just a source of damage, but also a valuable support. In physical damage teams, especially with characters like Eula or Razor, Rosaria plays the role of a Superconduct enabler\u2014lowering enemy physical resistance and enabling much higher physical damage. She also fits comfortably in Melt teams with Pyro characters like Xiangling or Bennett, as her Cryo application can trigger the high-multiplier Melt reaction when timed right. When it comes to artifacts, Rosaria has a few good options depending on the role. In Freeze teams, the 4-piece Blizzard Strayer set is ideal, as it boosts CRIT Rate significantly against frozen enemies, allowing her to stack CRIT DMG and hit hard. For a sub-DPS or mixed role, a 2-piece combo of Noblesse Oblige and Blizzard Strayer or Gladiator\u2019s Finale can work well. Stat-wise, aim for an ATK% or Energy Recharge Sands, a Cryo DMG Goblet, and a CRIT Rate or CRIT DMG Circlet, depending on how much CRIT Rate you want to share with her passive. She benefits from weapons like Favonius Lance for energy support, or Deathmatch and Dragonspine Spear if built for more damage. Rosaria\u2019s constellations enhance her performance steadily without being mandatory. At Constellation 1, she gains increased attack speed after using her Skill, helping her weave in more hits. Constellation 2 improves her Burst\u2019s CRIT Rate, and Constellation 4 regenerates energy for the team when her Burst lands CRITs, increasing rotation uptime. Her final constellation, C6, reduces enemy physical resistance for a time after her Burst, making her a powerful support for physical damage characters. Even at C0, she performs her role well, but her constellations make her smoother to use and more impactful in high-end content. Overall, Rosaria is a strong, consistent, and flexible Cryo character who fits into many teams without requiring high investment. Her ability to deal damage, support her teammates with CRIT buffs, and apply Cryo reliably makes her a highly efficient pick, especially for players looking for a character that balances offensive power with strategic utility. Whether you\u2019re freezing enemies in place or enabling huge physical crits, Rosaria does it all with ease and elegance."}, {"question": "Tell me about Shenhe", "answer": "Shenhe is a 5-star Cryo polearm user from Liyue, renowned for her stoic demeanor and elegant combat style. She serves a unique role in Genshin Impact as a Cryo support who dramatically enhances the Cryo damage of her teammates through both flat damage bonuses and Cryo Resistance shredding. Unlike typical supports who boost attack or provide healing, Shenhe specializes in empowering Cryo characters like Ganyu, Ayaka, Rosaria, or Chongyun, making her a crucial part of high-investment Freeze or Cryo burst teams. Her presence is subtle yet devastating, elevating Cryo team damage to new heights while maintaining a graceful, composed playstyle that reflects her background as a reclusive disciple of the adepti. Shenhe\u2019s Elemental Skill, **Spring Spirit Summoning**, is the cornerstone of her support capabilities. When used, she grants nearby allies the *Icy Quill* effect, which increases their Cryo damage by adding a flat damage bonus that scales based on her own Attack stat. This flat bonus is unique\u2014it doesn\u2019t scale multiplicatively like regular damage boosts but instead adds raw numbers to each Cryo hit, making her particularly effective at buffing fast multi-hit characters like Ayaka or Ganyu. Her Skill can be tapped for quicker use or held for greater AoE and longer buff duration, offering some flexibility in rotations. Her Elemental Burst, **Divine Maiden\u2019s Deliverance**, summons a talisman that periodically reduces enemies\u2019 Cryo and Physical resistance while dealing Cryo AoE damage over time. This further amplifies the output of Cryo DPS units and sets the stage for massive Freeze combos or Superconduct setups. Shenhe\u2019s best teams revolve around maximizing her Cryo support potential. She shines brightest when paired with Cryo main DPS characters like Kamisato Ayaka or Ganyu, who can trigger the Icy Quill effect repeatedly with their rapid Cryo-infused attacks or charged shots. In Freeze teams, she often partners with a Hydro applier such as Mona, Kokomi, or Xingqiu to lock down enemies, while Anemo units like Kazuha or Venti help group enemies and reduce resistance through Swirl reactions. In a Superconduct-focused team, she can support physical damage characters like Eula by reducing physical resistance and amplifying Cryo support damage through her buffs. While she isn\u2019t a healer or shielder, her sheer offensive support power makes her more than worth the team slot in Cryo-centered comps. For artifacts, Shenhe ideally uses the **4-piece Noblesse Oblige** set to provide both team-wide Attack buffs and strengthen her Burst. Alternatively, if someone else on the team already holds Noblesse, a 2-piece combo of **Attack% sets** like Gladiator\u2019s Finale, Shimenawa\u2019s Reminiscence, or Emblem of Severed Fate can increase her personal contribution. Her stats should focus heavily on **Attack%** across Sands, Goblet, and Circlet, since her Icy Quill buff scales purely from her Attack stat. Energy Recharge is also important to ensure consistent uptime on her Burst, especially in teams where she's not generating many particles herself. Polearms like **Calamity Queller** are tailor-made for her, massively boosting her base Attack and Cryo damage, while other solid options include **The Catch**, **Wavebreaker\u2019s Fin**, or **Favonius Lance** if energy is an issue. Shenhe\u2019s constellations further enhance her already potent support capabilities. At **Constellation 1**, she gains an extra charge of her Elemental Skill, letting her buff Cryo allies more frequently or chain them together in longer rotations. Her **Constellation 2** boosts her Skill's damage and adds a burst of AoE Cryo damage on cast, increasing her personal output. Higher constellations improve her resistance shred, energy generation, and damage over time, but even at **C0**, Shenhe performs her role superbly and requires no constellations to be impactful in high-end teams. In essence, Shenhe is a specialized but incredibly powerful Cryo buffer who transforms good Cryo teams into devastating ones. She isn\u2019t meant to be a generalist\u2014outside of Cryo or physical-centric teams, her impact is limited\u2014but when built properly and paired with the right allies, she\u2019s one of the most valuable supports for maximizing Cryo DPS potential. With a calm, refined playstyle and a visually striking skillset, Shenhe embodies the grace and lethality of Cryo combat, elevating her allies from strong to unstoppable."}, {"question": "Tell me about Clorinde", "answer": "Clorinde is a 5-star Electro sword user hailing from Fontaine, best known as the nation's Champion Duelist. Her personality is reserved and intensely focused, traits reflected in her sharp and poised combat style. As a main on-field Electro DPS, Clorinde offers a unique playstyle that blends close-range swordplay with ranged pistol shots. Her kit revolves around managing her state known as \u201cNight Vigil,\u201d which allows her to enter an empowered stance where she delivers rapid Electro-infused attacks, alternating between her blade and gun to deal heavy damage and apply Electro consistently. She excels when kept on-field, meaning she's best suited for teams that are built around supporting her uptime and damage output. Clorinde's Elemental Skill is at the heart of her playstyle. When activated, she enters Night Vigil state, converting her normal attacks into a hybrid sequence of Electro slashes and pistol shots. These attacks deal Electro damage and scale with her ATK, and the skill continuously heals her as long as she\u2019s damaging enemies. This self-sustain makes her quite durable in prolonged fights and allows her to minimize the need for a dedicated healer. Her Skill has a decent duration and a short cooldown, letting her maintain high uptime. Her Elemental Burst delivers a powerful finishing strike, dealing AoE Electro damage and refreshing her Skill duration, which helps keep her in her DPS stance without interruption. The synergy between her Skill and Burst forms the backbone of her combat rotation, and her gameplay rewards aggressive, precision-driven play. In terms of team composition, Clorinde thrives in Electro reaction-based teams, particularly Aggravate and Hyperbloom comps. For Aggravate teams, she works well alongside Dendro supports like Nahida or Baizhu, where her frequent Electro procs trigger Aggravate to boost her overall output. Electro batteries like Fischl or Raiden Shogun can help keep her Burst ready and support sustained Electro presence. In Hyperbloom setups, Clorinde can act as the Electro trigger for Dendro cores generated by Hydro characters such as Xingqiu or Furina, with Dendro appliers ensuring consistent core generation. She also functions well in mono-Electro teams with characters like Kuki Shinobu, Lisa, or Beidou, especially in content where reaction-focused damage isn\u2019t as critical. For artifacts, Clorinde has a few strong options depending on the team she's in. The best-in-slot for most Electro reaction-based setups is **4-piece Thundersoother**, which grants increased damage against Electro-affected enemies, complementing her rapid Electro application. Alternatively, **4-piece Gladiator\u2019s Finale** is solid for maximizing her normal attack damage in mono-Electro or non-reaction teams. **2-piece Thundering Fury + 2-piece ATK%** also works for a hybrid build. Main stats should focus on ATK% Sands, Electro DMG Bonus Goblet, and CRIT Rate or CRIT DMG Circlet. Substats should heavily prioritize CRIT stats, Energy Recharge (to maintain consistent Burst uptime), and ATK%. Her preferred weapons are high-crit swords or weapons that increase normal attack damage\u2014**Haran Geppaku Futsu**, **The Black Sword**, or **Mistsplitter Reforged** are ideal, but **Lion\u2019s Roar** is a good 4-star option if you\u2019re triggering Electro-related reactions. Clorinde\u2019s constellations are all oriented toward refining her on-field performance. **C1** makes her Electro application smoother and slightly increases her healing, keeping her healthier without external support. **C2** improves her Energy management by generating more particles during her Skill. **C4** enhances the damage of her pistol shots, increasing the strength of her ranged follow-ups. Her **C6** is a big spike in power, allowing her to refresh her Skill duration more frequently and deal bonus Electro damage based on her attacks, significantly extending her Night Vigil uptime and letting her stay on-field nearly indefinitely. Even at **C0**, Clorinde is perfectly viable and can deliver strong damage with the right support and artifact investment. In summary, Clorinde is a sleek and stylish Electro DPS whose kit rewards fast reactions, tight rotations, and smart positioning. Her dual weapon style makes her one of the more visually unique and mechanically satisfying sword characters in Genshin Impact, and her self-sustain, consistent Electro output, and high synergy with Dendro teams allow her to carve a strong niche in the game\u2019s meta. While she isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all DPS, when played in the right context and supported well, Clorinde is both elegant and deadly\u2014a true duelist in every sense."}, {"question": "Tell me about Sigewinne", "answer": "Sigewinne is a 5-star Hydro bow user from Fontaine, serving as the head nurse at the Fortress of Meropide. She is renowned for her exceptional healing abilities and her capacity to enhance her teammates' performance through unique buffs. Her reserved and caring demeanor is reflected in her role as a dedicated support character, focusing primarily on healing and team augmentation rather than personal damage output. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201\ue206 In combat, Sigewinne's playstyle centers around her Elemental Skill, which allows her to heal allies and provide buffs that enhance their off-field Elemental Skill damage. This makes her particularly effective in compositions that rely on off-field abilities to deal consistent damage. Her Elemental Burst offers additional healing and can deal Hydro damage, though it is less central to her role compared to her Skill. Players often prioritize her Skill over her Burst, especially in teams where her primary function is to sustain and support other characters. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search3\ue201\ue206 Sigewinne excels in team compositions that benefit from sustained healing and enhanced off-field damage. She synergizes well with characters like Furina, Nilou, and Nahida, forming effective Bloom teams where her healing ensures team survivability while amplifying the damage output of her allies. Her ability to buff off-field Elemental Skill damage makes her a valuable asset in various team setups that rely on such abilities. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue201\ue206 When selecting artifacts for Sigewinne, the **Song of Days Past** set is highly recommended. This set enhances her healing capabilities and provides additional buffs to the team. An alternative is the **Ocean-Hued Clam** set, which offers healing bonuses and can deal damage based on her healing output. For artifact main stats, focusing on HP% for the Sands, Goblet, and Circlet is optimal, as her healing scales with her maximum HP. Substats should prioritize HP%, flat HP, and Energy Recharge to ensure consistent healing and ability uptime. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search5\ue201\ue206 Regarding weapons, Sigewinne benefits from bows that enhance her healing abilities and Energy Recharge. The **Recurve Bow** is a suitable option, providing an HP% bonus that directly increases her healing effectiveness.

Higher constellations extend the duration of her abilities and significantly boost her critical stats, allowing her to contribute more effectively in various team compositions. \ue200cite\ue202turn0search7\ue201\ue206 In summary, Sigewinne is a dedicated healer and support character whose strengths lie in her ability to sustain her team and enhance their off-field damage capabilities. Her kit is tailored towards maximizing team survivability and performance, making her an invaluable asset in compositions that rely on consistent healing and buffs. By focusing on HP% in her artifacts and selecting weapons that complement her healing role, players can optimize Sigewinne's effectiveness on the battlefield.\ue206 "}, {"question": "Tell me about Alyo", "answer": "Aloy is a 5-star Cryo bow character introduced in Genshin Impact through a special collaboration with *Horizon Zero Dawn*, and while her arrival was exciting, her in-game performance places her as a niche option. Despite not having constellations\u2014unlike every other 5-star\u2014Aloy can still be built effectively as a quick-swap Cryo sub-DPS or even a Melt-focused main DPS when supported correctly. Her playstyle revolves around managing her unique Coil mechanic, which rewards consistent skill usage and a rhythm of normal attacks to enhance her Cryo-infused arrows. While her numbers may not match the top-tier Cryo characters, she still offers interesting utility and can be a decent choice for certain teams, especially for players who want to try a less-used character. Aloy\u2019s Elemental Skill, **Frozen Wilds**, throws a Freeze Bomb that explodes and scatters Chillwater Bomblets. These small bomblets detonate after a short delay or upon contact, dealing Cryo damage and granting her a Coil stack. After gaining four Coil stacks, she enters the **Rushing Ice** state, infusing her normal attacks with Cryo for a limited time and increasing their damage. This mechanic is central to her playstyle and incentivizes weaving in normal attacks after using her skill. Her Elemental Burst, **Prophecies of Dawn**, throws a Cryo Power Cell that detonates in a large AoE, dealing decent Cryo damage and costing only 40 Energy, allowing for frequent use in a rotation. While her personal damage is capped due to the lack of constellations, her kit works nicely for quickswap Cryo application or for triggering Melt reactions. When it comes to artifacts, Aloy fits best in two main styles depending on her team. In **Freeze teams**, the best option is the **4-piece Blizzard Strayer**, which boosts Cryo damage and gives a massive Crit Rate bonus against Frozen enemies\u2014this lets you focus on Crit Damage and ATK% in substats. If you're using her in **Melt teams**, a solid alternative is a 2-piece combination of **Blizzard Strayer** and **Gladiator\u2019s Finale** or **Shimenawa\u2019s Reminiscence** for a mix of Cryo damage and ATK. You can also use **Wanderer\u2019s Troupe** if you're focused on reaction damage. Her ideal main stats are **ATK% Sands**, **Cryo DMG Bonus Goblet**, and **Crit Rate/Crit DMG Circlet**, depending on your substat balance. Substats should prioritize Crit stats, ATK%, and Energy Recharge. In terms of weapons, Aloy doesn\u2019t have a signature bow, but she works well with general DPS options. **Polar Star** is her best-in-slot 5-star option, providing an all-around boost to her skill and burst damage as well as a strong Crit Rate bonus. **Skyward Harp** is also viable thanks to its high Crit stats. Among 4-star bows, **The Stringless** is useful for enhancing her Elemental Skill and Burst damage, and **Hamayumi** or **Prototype Crescent** can work in Melt setups where you're focused on normal attack strings. **Rust** is okay in Melt builds too, especially since Rushing Ice boosts her normal attacks. Aloy's team compositions vary depending on how you want to build her. In **Freeze comps**, she pairs well with **Hydro supports** like Xingqiu, Mona, or Kokomi, and **Anemo units** like Sucrose or Venti for grouping and resistance shred. This setup maximizes Blizzard Strayer\u2019s bonus and lets her maintain Cryo application through Rushing Ice. In **Melt teams**, she\u2019s best supported by **Bennett**, **Xiangling**, or **Thoma**, where she can trigger strong Melt reactions with her skill and normal attacks. She can also function in **Electro-Charged or Overload hybrid teams**, but these are less optimal. Since Aloy has no constellations available, she can\u2019t gain extra talent scaling, cooldown reductions, or energy boosts through them. This makes her slightly harder to build compared to other 5-stars, but also means you don\u2019t need to invest Primogems into her constellations\u2014what you see is what you get. Overall, Aloy is a fun character to experiment with, and while she\u2019s not meta-defining, she can definitely hold her own with proper investment. Her playstyle is best for players who enjoy managing a unique mechanic and building around reaction-focused teams."}, {"question": "Tell me about Ayaka", "answer": "Ayaka Kamisato is a five-star Cryo sword user from Inazuma who excels as a **powerful main DPS**, renowned for her elegant yet devastating playstyle. As the Shirasagi Himegimi of the Kamisato Clan, Ayaka combines grace and lethal precision, offering consistent Cryo damage and an ability to synergize extremely well in **Freeze and Melt teams**. Her strength lies in **elemental burst damage**, **high Cryo application**, and **mobility**, making her one of the top-tier damage dealers in Genshin Impact. Ayaka\u2019s playstyle revolves around **infused Normal Attacks** and **massive AoE Cryo nukes**. Her **alternate sprint (Kamisato Art: Senho)** allows her to dash under the surface, infusing her weapon with Cryo upon resurfacing. This sprint is not only stylish and fast but also practical\u2014it lets her cross water, reposition quickly, and ensures that all her Normal and Charged Attacks become Cryo-based for a duration. This makes her ideal for triggering **Freeze with Hydro units** or **Melt with Pyro supports**. Her **Elemental Skill, Kamisato Art: Hyouka**, is a simple yet strong AoE Cryo burst around her that quickly applies Cryo and deals decent damage. It\u2019s great for generating energy particles, clearing small mobs, and setting up reactions. However, Ayaka\u2019s true power is in her **Elemental Burst, Kamisato Art: Soumetsu**, where she summons a large Cryo storm that travels forward, slashing enemies continuously and dealing **extremely high Cryo damage** over time. This Burst scales well, covers a wide area, and is the centerpiece of her rotation, especially when **paired with elemental reactions like Freeze or Melt**. Ayaka fits perfectly into **Freeze teams**, where her constant Cryo application can lock enemies in place with the help of Hydro characters like **Mona, Kokomi, or Xingqiu**. A Freeze team with **Mona and Kazuha** can trigger powerful **Frozen-Shatter or crit-boosted Burst combos**, especially with Mona\u2019s Omen effect. She also performs well in **Melt teams**, though less common, where characters like **Bennett, Xiangling, or even Dehya** can help trigger Cryo into Pyro for massive single-target damage. Her kit benefits immensely from **crowd control**, so pairing her with **Kazuha or Venti** allows her Burst to hit multiple enemies efficiently and ensures optimal AoE coverage. Ayaka\u2019s best artifact set is **Blizzard Strayer (4-piece)**, which provides both Cryo DMG Bonus and a massive Crit Rate increase against Frozen enemies. This set allows her to stack more **Crit DMG** and still maintain high crit consistency in Freeze teams. If using her outside of Freeze compositions, a **2-piece Blizzard + 2-piece Gladiator/Shimenawa/Noblesse** can work, though the 4-piece Strayer is far superior for her best teams. Main stats should be **ATK% Sands**, **Cryo DMG Goblet**, and **Crit DMG Circlet** (or Crit Rate if not using Strayer). Sub-stats should focus on **Crit stats**, **Energy Recharge**, and **ATK%**. For weapons, Ayaka\u2019s best-in-slot is the **Mistsplitter Reforged**, a five-star sword that boosts Elemental DMG and grants stacks for increased performance across her entire kit. Other excellent five-star options include **Primordial Jade Cutter** and **Haran Geppaku Futsu** due to their Crit stats and synergy with Ayaka\u2019s fast attack style. For four-star weapons, **Amenoma Kageuchi** is an outstanding free-to-play option that helps with energy regeneration and allows a smoother rotation with her costly Burst. **Blackcliff Longsword** and **The Black Sword** are decent alternatives for Crit stats, though they lack energy utility. Ayaka\u2019s **constellations** are meaningful but not required for her to dominate. **C1** increases her Normal and Charged Attack damage against Cryo-affected enemies, adding to her DPS, while **C2** increases her Energy Recharge, smoothing her rotation and allowing for more frequent Bursts. **C4** lowers enemy DEF after hitting them with her Burst, which is a powerful debuff for team damage, and her **C6** dramatically increases her Charged Attack damage following her alternate sprint, leading to monstrous single-target performance. Despite this, Ayaka is already top-tier at **C0**, and players will find her fully capable of clearing endgame content without constellations. In summary, Ayaka is an **exceptionally strong Cryo DPS** who thrives in Freeze-focused teams and shines through her fluid animation, high burst potential, and synergy with crowd control and Hydro supports. Her ability to deliver huge Cryo damage in a short window makes her a favorite in the Spiral Abyss and other high-stakes content. Whether you admire her refined personality or are seeking a top-tier main DPS with style and grace, Ayaka is a powerful and reliable investment for any player\u2019s roster."}, {"question": "Tell me about Ayato", "answer": "Ayato is a five-star Hydro sword user from Inazuma who plays the role of a **main or sub-DPS** with a playstyle centered around **fast, elegant slashes and consistent Hydro application**. As the head of the Kamisato Clan, Ayato blends style with power, delivering graceful yet deadly attacks that make him a standout pick for **Vaporize, Freeze, and Hyperbloom** compositions. He is valued for his **on-field DPS uptime**, **smooth skill rotations**, and how well he synergizes with a wide range of elemental supports. Ayato\u2019s **Elemental Skill, Kamisato Art: Kyouka**, transforms his normal attacks into a flurry of Hydro-infused strikes called Shunsuiken attacks, dealing AoE Hydro damage that scales with his max HP. While in this state, he rapidly slashes at enemies and can maintain mobility during the duration, making him agile and effective in applying Hydro to multiple enemies quickly. The Skill also grants stacks based on the number of enemies hit before activating, maximizing his damage output. This makes Ayato a **highly reliable Hydro enabler**, especially when paired with characters who can capitalize on constant Hydro, like Xiangling for Vaporize or Cryo characters for Freeze. His **Elemental Burst, Kamisato Art: Suiyuu**, creates a large AoE water field where spectral water blades continuously rain down on enemies, dealing Hydro damage over time and increasing the Normal Attack damage of characters within the area. This field allows Ayato to **deal sustained off-field Hydro damage** even when he's not actively on the field, making him a valuable sub-DPS in quickswap teams or a persistent enabler in Freeze or Hyperbloom comps. It\u2019s also a strong support tool when paired with melee characters that rely on Normal Attacks, such as Yoimiya or Cyno. Ayato fits into a variety of team compositions depending on your goal. In **Vaporize teams**, pairing him with **Xiangling, Bennett, or Klee** allows him to amplify his Hydro damage through Pyro reactions. In **Freeze teams**, he synergizes beautifully with characters like **Ganyu, Rosaria, or Ayaka**, applying Hydro steadily for constant Freeze uptime. In **Hyperbloom or Bloom teams**, he supports Dendro cores effectively when combined with **Nahida, Alhaitham, or Yaoyao**, and an Electro unit like **Raiden or Kuki** can then trigger Hyperbloom consistently. Thanks to his flexibility, he can be both a **self-sufficient carry** and a **valuable off-field Hydro applicator**. Ayato\u2019s best artifact set for most builds is **Echoes of an Offering (4-piece)**, which increases Normal Attack damage and fits his playstyle perfectly, especially in teams where he's the main DPS. However, this set is somewhat RNG-dependent. For more consistent results, **Heart of Depth (4-piece)** remains a strong choice, boosting both Hydro damage and Normal Attacks. If you're focusing on Burst uptime and sub-DPS play, **Emblem of Severed Fate (4-piece)** works very well, especially if you stack Energy Recharge. Main stats should be **ATK% or HP% Sands** (depending on how you build him), **Hydro DMG Bonus Goblet**, and **Crit Rate or Crit DMG Circlet**. Sub-stats should prioritize **Crit stats, Energy Recharge, and ATK% or HP%** based on the chosen build. When it comes to weapons, Ayato\u2019s best-in-slot is **Haran Geppaku Futsu**, which enhances his Normal Attacks and offers Crit Rate and Elemental DMG buffs. Other five-star swords like **Primordial Jade Cutter** and **Mistsplitter Reforged** are also excellent due to their Crit stats and synergy with his skill rotation. For four-star options, **Black Sword** is a great pick with Crit Rate and healing, while **Amenoma Kageuchi** is a strong free-to-play option that supports his energy needs and smoothens rotations. **Lion\u2019s Roar** can work in Vaporize comps, and **Sacrificial Sword** is situational but offers cooldown resets for extra Skill uptime if used creatively. Ayato\u2019s **constellations** are designed to enhance his DPS potential further. **C1** increases his max Shunsuiken stacks and shortens cooldowns, making his Skill more spammable and boosting his uptime. **C2** provides a significant HP% bonus, which benefits both his Skill damage and survivability. **C4** increases the damage of his Burst over time, and his **C6** supercharges his Skill to deal more frequent attacks and increase the overall damage ceiling. While he\u2019s already extremely strong at **C0**, his constellations notably enhance his performance and make his damage output even more fluid and deadly. In essence, Ayato is a **stylish, fast-paced Hydro DPS** who thrives in **reaction-heavy teams**, whether you're freezing enemies in place or triggering a cascade of Bloom reactions. His blend of fluid animation, powerful Hydro application, and team flexibility makes him one of the most rewarding characters to build and play. Whether you\u2019re looking for a graceful main carry or a consistent enabler with off-field presence, Ayato brings elegance, power, and strategic depth to any team composition."}, {"question": "Tell me about Candace", "answer": "Candace is a four-star Hydro polearm user from Sumeru who brings a very unique and niche support role to Genshin Impact. As the guardian of Aaru Village, she stands as a defensive, shield-wielding protector who supports her allies with **Hydro infusion, parry mechanics, and team buffs**. Her playstyle is not centered around high personal damage but instead offers **utility through off-field Hydro application and team-wide Normal Attack enhancement**, especially for physical and elemental infusion-based characters. Candace\u2019s **Elemental Skill, Sacred Rite: Heron\u2019s Sanctum**, allows her to either tap or hold the skill to perform a shielded parry. Holding the Skill raises her shield, and when hit or when manually released, it unleashes a leaping strike that deals Hydro damage in a small AoE. While the parry effect is satisfying and thematic, its practical application in combat is more about **timing and triggering a defensive burst of Hydro** rather than constant reaction support. Still, it can apply Hydro to enemies in a pinch and can be used to trigger reactions like Vaporize or Electro-Charged depending on the team. Her **Elemental Burst, Sacred Rite: Wagtail\u2019s Tide**, is her true support highlight. When activated, Candace summons a watery blessing that deals AoE Hydro damage and grants **Hydro infusion to melee characters' Normal Attacks**. This effect allows sword, polearm, and claymore users to deal Hydro damage with their Normal Attacks, enabling characters who don\u2019t usually apply Hydro on their own\u2014like Keqing, Razor, or even Albedo\u2014to participate in elemental reactions. The Burst also boosts the damage of Normal Attacks for all party members, regardless of their weapon, making it a niche but functional **Normal Attack buffer**. Candace works best in teams that are **Normal Attack-centric** or where **Hydro infusion has synergy with reaction-based setups**. She pairs well with characters like **Cyno, Razor, or Eula**, who primarily use Normal Attacks or benefit from off-field Hydro application to trigger Superconduct or other reactions. While she\u2019s not as strong in typical Freeze or Vaporize comps due to limited Hydro uptime, she can support characters who want occasional Hydro application without taking up much field time. She can also enable interesting **quickswap or off-meta teams**, where her infusion opens up unique reaction paths. For artifacts, Candace benefits most from **Noblesse Oblige (4-piece)**, which increases her team\u2019s ATK after using her Burst\u2014helpful since she won\u2019t deal much damage herself but can provide strong teamwide buffs. **Emblem of Severed Fate (4-piece)** is another good set if you want to scale her Burst damage and make her more self-sufficient with Energy Recharge. Main stats should typically include an **HP% Sands**, **HP% or Hydro DMG Goblet**, and **HP% or Healing Bonus Circlet**, since her abilities scale with HP and she doesn\u2019t rely heavily on Crit stats. Sub-stats should prioritize **Energy Recharge, HP%, and some Elemental Mastery** if using her in reaction-heavy teams. In terms of weapons, Candace is flexible and works well with **support-oriented polearms**. **Favonius Lance** is one of her best options, giving her energy regeneration and allowing her to help recharge the team. **Black Tassel** is a surprisingly effective low-rarity weapon, boosting her HP and allowing for better scaling on her abilities. **The Catch** is another solid pick if you want to increase her Burst damage and Energy Recharge. Five-star weapons like **Engulfing Lightning** or **Staff of Homa** are overkill but can be used if you\u2019re min-maxing her stats for a unique role or specific team synergy. Candace\u2019s **constellations** give her a few key improvements. Her **C1** allows the team to ignore a portion of an enemy\u2019s Hydro resistance while under her Burst, helping make reactions more consistent and impactful. **C2** increases her Skill\u2019s AoE and makes her shield more durable. **C4** provides an HP restoration effect that boosts survivability. Her **C6** increases the damage bonus from her Burst\u2019s infusion effect and makes it scale with her max HP, giving a significant team-wide Normal Attack buff for melee characters and enhancing her niche as a Hydro support. While she's functional at **C0**, her **C6 is a meaningful power spike** if you're leaning into her unique role. Ultimately, Candace is a **thematic and utility-focused support character**. She won\u2019t fit into every team, and her Hydro application and buffs are somewhat limited in comparison to more meta options. However, she offers a **fun, off-beat way to play** and creates creative opportunities for reaction teams, especially for players who enjoy mixing mechanics and using underappreciated characters. If you like building off-meta comps or are exploring physical/infusion-based playstyles, Candace adds a layer of tactical flexibility and stylistic flair to your team."}, {"question": "Tell me about Charlotte", "answer": "Charlotte is a four-star Cryo catalyst user from Fontaine, working as an investigative journalist for The Steambird. She brings a unique blend of **healing and off-field Cryo application**, making her a versatile support who fits especially well in Freeze, Superconduct, and even Melt-based teams. While her personal damage isn\u2019t her main selling point, Charlotte provides excellent **team sustain, utility, and consistent Cryo aura**, all while maintaining a charming presence on the battlefield. Her playstyle is smooth and rhythm-focused, built around **timely healing and Elemental Skill uptime**. Her **Elemental Skill, Framing: Freezing Point Composition**, has Charlotte raise her camera and snap a photo of enemies in front of her, dealing Cryo damage in a wide frontal arc and applying a **unique mechanic called Snappy Silhouette**. This silhouette tracks enemies and triggers additional Cryo damage after a short delay, which makes it especially valuable for setting up **Cryo-based reactions**. Because the Skill has decent AoE and a low cooldown, it\u2019s a consistent method for applying Cryo in quickswap teams or reaction-heavy comps, especially Freeze setups with Hydro units like Ayato or Kokomi. Charlotte\u2019s **Elemental Burst, Still Photo: Comprehensive Confirmation**, is where she transitions from support into full healer mode. Upon casting, she creates a **field that heals all party members over time**, scaling with her max HP, and simultaneously **periodically deals Cryo damage** to enemies within the AoE. This dual-purpose design makes Charlotte a natural fit in **teams that want a Cryo enabler and sustain** in one slot. Her Burst has a generous radius and duration, which allows her to heal from off-field while enabling Cryo reactions with characters like Mona, Xingqiu, or Sucrose. Her Cryo application from the Burst isn\u2019t rapid, but it\u2019s steady enough for Freeze maintenance or superconduct support. Charlotte fits best into **Freeze teams** where Hydro units are present to consistently proc Frozen, or into **Superconduct teams** with Physical carries like Eula or Razor. She\u2019s also useful in **Melt teams** if you have strong Pyro application from units like Xiangling or Klee, allowing Charlotte to set up the Cryo side of the reaction. Since her healing scales off **HP**, she doubles as a defensive support, making her a strong option in Abyss content where you want Cryo control and healing without sacrificing a team slot for a full healer. She can also be used in **Mono Cryo teams** as a Cryo resonance enabler and source of consistent energy generation. Her best artifact set depends on the role you want her to play. For a **support/healer build**, **Ocean-Hued Clam (4-piece)** is ideal, allowing her to turn healing into bonus damage. If you\u2019re focusing more on Cryo uptime and reaction support, **Noblesse Oblige (4-piece)** is excellent for team ATK buffs and Burst enhancement. Alternatively, **Tenacity of the Millelith (4-piece)** can work if you're building her HP-heavy for teamwide support and boosting allies' ATK with her Skill hits. Main stats should focus on **HP% Sands**, **Cryo DMG Bonus or HP% Goblet**, and **Healing Bonus or HP% Circlet**. Sub-stats should include **Energy Recharge**, **HP%**, and **Crit Rate/DMG** if building her for Clam damage. For weapons, Charlotte\u2019s best-in-slot four-star option is **Favonius Codex**, which gives her Energy Recharge and team battery potential. **Prototype Amber** is another excellent free-to-play choice that enhances her healing and helps regenerate energy. If you\u2019re building her with some offensive potential, **Hakushin Ring** is useful in Electro-Charged teams for additional buffs, and **Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers** provides a massive ATK buff to the next on-field character, ideal for Freeze or Melt comps with strong main DPS units. For five-star options, **Everlasting Moonglow** or **Skyward Atlas** can be considered, though they may be overkill for her role. Charlotte\u2019s **constellations** add nice quality-of-life upgrades to her kit. Her **C1** allows for more frequent use of her Skill and helps her maintain Cryo uptime. **C2** improves the healing from her Burst, making her an even stronger team sustainer. **C4** adds a teamwide Crit Rate bonus against Cryo-affected enemies, which is great in Freeze or Mono Cryo teams. Her **C6** significantly boosts her ability to sustain the team and strengthens the Cryo application from her Burst, effectively rounding out her support and healing capabilities. While she\u2019s perfectly solid at **C0**, each constellation adds meaningful boosts to her utility and team synergy. In summary, Charlotte is a **reliable Cryo support and healer** who brings **stable elemental application, healing, and off-field presence** in a compact, elegant package. She\u2019s a welcome addition to Freeze teams and offers new tools for players seeking Cryo utility without committing to traditional healers or sacrificing damage. Whether you're pairing her with Fontaine\u2019s Hydro characters, Physical DPS units, or Pyro reaction teams, Charlotte adds stability and control while delivering that journalistic flair only a Steambird reporter could provide."}, {"question": "Tell me about Chevreuse", "answer": "Chevreuse is a four-star Pyro polearm user introduced from Fontaine, and she brings a refreshing take on a support/sub-DPS character built around enabling and **enhancing Overloaded reaction teams**. As a captain of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol, Chevreuse brings both tactical flair and battlefield control, lending strong Pyro application, buffs, and team synergy to compositions that traditionally struggled with Overloaded\u2019s chaotic knockback nature. Her playstyle is built around amplifying damage through reaction-based strategies, making her ideal for players who enjoy **elemental reaction-driven teams** and strategic party coordination. Chevreuse\u2019s **Elemental Skill, Short-Range Rapid Interdiction Fire**, fires a grenade that deals AoE Pyro damage and applies her unique mark to enemies. Upon holding the skill, she enters an aiming stance and lobs a more focused grenade, still delivering the same Pyro application but with better control and range. This Skill is a consistent and **controllable way to apply Pyro**, and thanks to its mark mechanic, it sets up her other abilities for increased damage or synergy. Her Skill is central to maintaining uptime on Pyro for reaction setups, especially when cycling through characters in **quick-swap teams**. Her **Elemental Burst, Ring of Bursting Grenades**, is a flashy and satisfying Pyro AoE that deals continuous damage in a circular field, while also **buffing Overloaded reaction damage** dealt by party members. The main draw of her Burst isn\u2019t raw damage but rather its ability to **create reaction opportunities and boost the value of other characters\u2019 abilities**, particularly Electro and Pyro units. This makes her a highly flexible unit in **Overload-centric teams**, which historically have been considered chaotic due to enemy knockback but are now much more viable thanks to her support scaling. Chevreuse shines in teams where **Electro and Pyro characters are used together**, ideally with one of each element present to trigger her **passive team buffs**. Characters like **Beidou, Fischl, or Raiden Shogun** on the Electro side, and **Yoimiya, Xiangling, or Thoma** on the Pyro side, all benefit from her Overloaded-enhancing capabilities. She also works well with **Electro Traveler**, who provides consistent Electro application and battery utility. Her role in these teams is to **maintain consistent Pyro aura**, enable reactions, and offer strong buffs to Overloaded damage and even **ATK% bonuses** if both Pyro and Electro characters are present. For artifact sets, Chevreuse is best equipped with **Noblesse Oblige (4-piece)**, which increases her team\u2019s ATK after using her Burst and complements her utility-oriented role. If focusing more on Pyro application and reaction triggers, **Emblem of Severed Fate (4-piece)** is also effective, especially if you stack Energy Recharge and want her Burst up often. Alternatively, you can consider **2-piece sets that boost Energy Recharge and Pyro DMG**, such as a **2-piece Emblem + 2-piece Crimson Witch** combo for balanced support and reaction damage. Main stats should typically include **ER or HP% Sands**, **Pyro DMG Goblet**, and **Crit or HP% Circlet**, depending on how much damage you want her to deal versus how support-focused you want her to be. Sub-stats should prioritize **Energy Recharge, HP%, and Crit** (if building her for some personal damage). For weapons, Chevreuse can use a variety of polearms depending on your goal. If building her for utility and support, **Favonius Lance** is excellent, offering high Energy Recharge and team particle generation. **The Catch** is another strong free-to-play option that boosts her Burst damage and Energy Recharge. If you\u2019re focusing on HP-scaling and want her to have stronger survivability or shielding synergies, **Black Tassel** is a budget-friendly pick that gives a hefty HP bonus. For a more offensive build, polearms like **Dragon\u2019s Bane** (for EM and boosting reaction damage) or **Kitain Cross Spear** (for Skill and energy synergy) also work well, especially in Overload-focused setups. Chevreuse\u2019s **constellations** further improve her utility and ability to maintain field presence. Her early constellations reduce skill cooldowns and provide more team buffs, making her easier to rotate in and out during active fights. Her **C4** increases Pyro RES shred, which helps Pyro DPS characters significantly, and **C6** boosts her supportive value by increasing Overloaded reaction damage even further while enhancing team-wide performance. Even at **C0**, she\u2019s fully functional as a reaction enabler and buffer, but constellations elevate her utility and team synergy dramatically. In summary, Chevreuse is a **reaction support specialist** who finally makes **Overloaded teams not just viable, but competitive**. With strong Pyro application, versatile buffing capabilities, and synergy with both Pyro and Electro characters, she opens up new and fun playstyles for players looking to break the mold of traditional meta teams. Whether you\u2019re assembling an Overload-centric squad or just want a support who brings solid Pyro presence and utility, Chevreuse adds tactical depth and reaction-focused fun to any roster."}, {"question": "Tell me about Childe", "answer": "Childe, also known as Tartaglia, is a five-star Hydro bow user from Snezhnaya and a member of the Fatui Harbingers. He stands out as one of Genshin Impact\u2019s most **unique and dynamic main DPS characters** due to his **stance-switching mechanics** that allow him to seamlessly move between ranged and melee combat. Childe\u2019s playstyle revolves around **timing and burst damage**, with a high-risk, high-reward approach that can dominate fights when executed correctly. He thrives in **quick-swap and rotation-based teams**, where his powerful AoE Hydro application enables devastating elemental reactions, especially **Vaporize**. Childe\u2019s **Elemental Skill, Foul Legacy: Raging Tide**, transforms his bow into dual Hydro blades, allowing him to enter a melee stance where all his Normal and Charged Attacks deal Hydro damage. While in this stance, his attacks become extremely fast and deal AoE Hydro damage with each strike, making him one of the best Hydro applicators in the game. This skill has a cooldown that scales with how long he remains in melee stance, so timing is critical\u2014**staying in too long results in a long cooldown**, which can break the team\u2019s rhythm, but exiting early allows for smoother rotations and frequent re-engagements. The optimal use involves staying in melee for 6 to 9 seconds per rotation to balance damage and cooldowns. Childe\u2019s **Elemental Burst** has two forms, depending on which stance he is in. In ranged stance, **Havoc: Flash of Havoc** fires a powerful Hydro shot that deals AoE damage and applies Riptide, a special mark that causes extra damage when enemies are hit again. In melee stance, **Havoc: Obliteration** unleashes a massive AoE slash that deals high Hydro damage, especially potent when used on multiple enemies affected by Riptide. His Burst damage scales well with both raw stats and elemental reactions, and the **melee Burst in particular is one of the hardest-hitting attacks in the game**, especially when paired with Pyro characters for Vaporize. Childe is most commonly used in **Vaporize teams**, where Pyro units like **Xiangling, Bennett, or Klee** help him trigger frequent and powerful reactions thanks to his rapid Hydro application. He is a core part of the well-known **National Team variant \u201cInternational\u201d**, where he is paired with Xiangling, Bennett, and a fourth unit like Kazuha, Sucrose, or Chongyun. In these teams, Childe applies Hydro quickly while Xiangling\u2019s Pyronado triggers Vaporize, leading to extremely high team-wide DPS. Childe can also be used in **Electro-Charged** or **Freeze teams**, though his Hydro uptime and AoE focus make Vaporize his best synergy overall. Childe\u2019s best artifact set is the **Heart of Depth (4-piece)**, which boosts both Hydro damage and Normal/Charged Attacks after using a skill\u2014perfectly aligned with his melee stance rotation. Another solid option is **2-piece Heart of Depth + 2-piece Noblesse Oblige**, or **2-piece Heart + 2-piece Gladiator/Shimenawa** for early or flexible builds. His ideal artifact stats include an **ATK% Sands**, **Hydro DMG Goblet**, and **Crit Rate or Crit DMG Circlet**, depending on weapon and sub-stat balance. Sub-stats should focus on **Crit, ATK%, and Energy Recharge**, with some **Elemental Mastery** for boosting reaction damage. When it comes to weapons, Childe\u2019s **signature five-star bow, Polar Star**, is his best-in-slot. It offers high Crit Rate and a stacking damage bonus for skills and bursts, which perfectly complements his rotation-heavy playstyle. **Thundering Pulse** and **Aqua Simulacra** are also strong five-star options that focus on Crit and general DPS. Among four-star weapons, **The Viridescent Hunt** (Battle Pass) is excellent for Crit Rate and crowd control, while **Rust** is a top pick for increasing Normal Attack damage, especially in melee stance. **Stringless** is viable for boosting Elemental Skill and Burst damage in reaction-focused setups, although it\u2019s less consistent than Rust. Childe\u2019s **constellations** further enhance his damage output and flexibility. **C1** reduces his melee stance cooldown, making it easier to maintain fluid rotations. **C2** increases his Riptide effects, boosting AoE potential. **C4** provides an ATK buff when enemies are defeated, which helps in multi-wave content. His **C6** is a game-changer, removing the melee stance cooldown entirely, allowing you to stay in his most powerful form indefinitely\u2014this turns him into a true powerhouse but is not necessary for strong performance. Even at **C0**, Childe is a top-tier DPS if played correctly. Overall, Childe is a **mechanically demanding but incredibly rewarding** character. His **stance-switching playstyle, high AoE Hydro output, and synergy with reaction teams** make him one of the most versatile and explosive damage dealers in Genshin Impact. Mastering Childe involves understanding rotation timing, energy management, and team synergy, but once you do, he can become the centerpiece of a high-damage, fast-paced team that clears content with style and efficiency."}, {"question": "Tell me about Cyno", "answer": "Cyno is a five-star Electro polearm user from Sumeru who fulfills the role of a **hypercarry main DPS**, specializing in sustained on-field damage through his Elemental Burst form. With his stoic, justice-driven persona and love for terrible jokes, Cyno brings a unique flair to Electro DPS characters, and his playstyle is heavily focused on maximizing uptime during his Burst window. He thrives in teams that can **feed him energy, enable fast reactions**, and allow him to stay on-field to dish out constant damage. Building and playing Cyno well revolves around **timing, reaction synergy**, and having enough support to fuel his long active time. Cyno\u2019s **Elemental Skill, Secret Rite: Chasmic Soulfarer**, is a quick lunge that deals Electro damage. Outside his Burst, it\u2019s a modest attack, but during his Burst state, using the Skill triggers a coordinated follow-up slash, greatly increasing its damage potential. This incentivizes you to use the Skill **repeatedly during his Burst** to maximize DPS. The cooldown is short enough to weave into combos smoothly, and the reaction potential from consistent Electro application makes it ideal for Aggravate or Hyperbloom setups. Additionally, hitting enemies with his Skill generates energy particles, which help fuel his expensive Elemental Burst. Cyno\u2019s **Elemental Burst, Sacred Rite: Wolf\u2019s Swiftness**, transforms him into a **stance-based melee form**, similar to Razor or Xiao. During this mode, Cyno infuses his attacks with Electro and enhances his Elemental Skill. His Normal, Charged, and Plunging Attacks are replaced with high-speed Electro strikes that scale with his stats and benefit from his Talent multipliers. The stance lasts for an extended duration, encouraging **on-field time**, and any interruptions in rotation or swapping will reduce his overall output. To get the most out of Cyno, your team must rotate quickly and allow him to stay active for the full Burst duration, roughly 18 seconds with minimal downtime. In terms of team composition, Cyno performs best in **Dendro reaction teams**, specifically **Aggravate** and **Hyperbloom**. In Aggravate teams, he\u2019s paired with a **Dendro unit** like Nahida, Alhaitham, or the Dendro Traveler, and an **Electro support** like Fischl or Dori to provide energy and additional triggers. **Kazuha** or **Sucrose** can slot in to group enemies and offer Elemental Mastery boosts. For Hyperbloom, adding **Hydro units** like Xingqiu or Yelan can enable rapid Bloom production, and Cyno will trigger the Hyperbloom reactions with his fast-paced Electro strikes. Because Cyno needs energy to keep his Burst going every rotation, teams should be built with **multiple energy particles in mind**, often via batteries or ER gear. Cyno\u2019s best artifact set is **Gilded Dreams (4-piece)**, which boosts his Elemental Mastery and ATK depending on the team\u2019s elements, making it perfect for both Aggravate and Hyperbloom builds. For pure Electro damage builds, **Thundering Fury (4-piece)** is also viable, especially for reducing Skill cooldowns and increasing his reaction-based output. Alternatively, a **2-piece Thundering Fury + 2-piece EM or ATK%** combo can work for more flexible builds. Main stats should focus on **EM or ATK% Sands** (EM for reaction builds, ATK% for pure damage), **Electro DMG Bonus Goblet**, and **Crit Rate or Crit DMG Circlet**, depending on your weapon and stat balance. Sub-stats should aim for **Crit, EM, and ER**. For weapons, Cyno\u2019s signature five-star polearm, **Staff of the Scarlet Sands**, is his best-in-slot. It provides Crit Rate and converts Elemental Mastery into ATK, synergizing perfectly with his reaction-based kit. Other strong five-star options include **Primordial Jade Winged-Spear**, **Staff of Homa**, and **Calamity Queller**, though some may require stat balancing. Among four-stars, **Deathmatch** (from the Battle Pass) and **White Tassel** (for budget Crit Rate) are solid choices. If you want to emphasize Elemental Mastery, **Moonpiercer** or **Kitain Cross Spear** can be surprisingly effective, particularly in Hyperbloom teams. Cyno\u2019s **constellations** enhance his consistency and burst potential. **C1** allows him to gain 20% Electro DMG during his Burst, which adds a nice damage boost. **C2** improves his Energy generation and makes it easier to sustain his rotations. **C4** provides further EM boosts that synergize with his reaction builds. His **C6**, as expected, significantly boosts his damage by increasing Crit DMG and giving him extra Skill charges, making his combo rotations smoother and more explosive. While he is perfectly functional at **C0**, having **C2 or higher** makes him more fluid and comfortable to play. In summary, Cyno is a fast-paced, field-focused Electro DPS who thrives in **Dendro reaction teams** that can support his long Burst uptime. His kit rewards precision, rhythm, and synergy with off-field units that enable reactions and battery his energy needs. Though he demands tight rotations and careful team setup, the payoff is a **flashy, sustained Electro playstyle** that feels both rewarding and stylish. For players who enjoy the thrill of being constantly active on the battlefield with consistent reaction-based damage, Cyno is a highly satisfying and competitive choice."}, {"question": "Tell me about Diona", "answer": "Diona is a four-star Cryo bow user from Mondstadt who offers a well-rounded support role through her **healing, shielding, and Cryo application**. As the bartender of the Cat\u2019s Tail and a spirited hater of alcohol, Diona\u2019s quirky personality contrasts with her powerful utility on the battlefield. She\u2019s a staple support character in many teams because of her ability to **sustain the team defensively while enabling Cryo-related reactions** like Freeze and Superconduct. Diona excels in compositions where survivability and consistent Cryo application are important, and she remains relevant even as new support characters are released. Her **Elemental Skill, Icy Paws**, is her primary defensive tool. When pressed, Diona dashes forward and fires two Cryo projectiles that generate a small shield based on her max HP. When held, she fires five projectiles, creating a stronger shield and applying Cryo more widely. The shield absorbs damage and provides 250% absorption efficiency against Cryo damage, making her a top pick for protecting characters during heavy Cryo encounters or Abyss floors filled with freezing mechanics. The shield's duration and strength scale with her HP, so building her with HP% stats greatly enhances her performance. Diona\u2019s **Elemental Burst, Signature Mix**, tosses a special cocktail that creates a **healing field** in a small AoE. Allies within the field receive **continuous healing over time**, which also scales with Diona\u2019s max HP. Simultaneously, the field deals **Cryo damage** to enemies inside it, making her one of the rare characters who can heal and apply an element simultaneously in a persistent area. This makes her particularly valuable in **Freeze teams** with characters like Ayaka, Ganyu, or Mona, where consistent Cryo application is key to locking enemies in place. It\u2019s also helpful in **Superconduct teams**, reducing enemy physical resistance and enabling physical DPS units like Eula. Diona shines in teams that want both **defensive utility and Cryo synergy**. In Freeze teams, she can serve as a Cryo battery and applier while keeping the team healthy and protected. In **Physical teams**, especially those using Eula or Razor, Diona\u2019s ability to trigger Superconduct through her skill or Burst reduces physical resistance on enemies, greatly boosting overall DPS. She can also be used effectively in **Overworld or casual co-op** play, where her shield and healing make her a reliable utility character for newer or less optimized teams. Her ranged Cryo application also lets her safely apply Cryo to targets for setting up reactions from a distance. When it comes to artifacts, Diona\u2019s most common and effective choice is the **Noblesse Oblige (4-piece)** set, which boosts team ATK after using her Burst. Since she doesn\u2019t rely on personal damage and uses her Burst frequently, this set maximizes her team support value. Another viable set is the **Tenacity of the Millelith (4-piece)**, especially if she\u2019s being used for shield uptime and you want her to also buff the team\u2019s ATK. If energy is an issue, a **2-piece Emblem of Severed Fate + 2-piece HP% or Tenacity** build can help balance healing and ER. Her ideal main stats are **HP% Sands**, **HP% Goblet**, and **Healing Bonus Circlet**, with sub-stats focused on **Energy Recharge** and more HP%. For weapons, **Favonius Warbow** is her top choice in most builds. It provides Energy Recharge and team-wide particle generation when she lands crits, which helps maintain her Burst uptime and contribute energy to other characters. **Sacrificial Bow** is also strong, allowing her to reset her Skill cooldown and generate more Cryo particles, improving shield uptime. **Recurve Bow**, though a three-star weapon, gives a massive HP boost and is a solid early-game choice for maximizing healing and shielding. **Elegy for the End**, a five-star bow, can further support reaction-based teams with its Elemental Mastery and ATK buffs, though it's a luxury option. Diona\u2019s **constellations** significantly enhance her performance. **C1** increases her shield strength and duration, which is already helpful. **C2** reduces enemy ATK within her Burst, providing extra team protection. **C5** boosts her Burst level, increasing her healing output. But her most game-changing constellation is **C6**, which gives **Energy Recharge to characters inside her Burst zone**, helping battery characters like Eula or Ayaka maintain Burst uptime. This makes her an excellent support in energy-hungry comps and adds utility beyond healing and shielding. Overall, Diona is an extremely versatile support who provides **survivability, Cryo application, and energy utility**. Whether in Freeze, Physical, or hybrid teams, she offers consistent value with her shields and heals, while her constellations only improve her ability to serve the whole team. She\u2019s a fantastic pick for players who want to **stabilize their team**, apply Cryo consistently, and enable powerful elemental reactions. Diona\u2019s reliability, low investment needs, and defensive strength have made her a long-standing favorite in both the Abyss and casual play."}, {"question": "Tell me about Dori", "answer": "Dori is a four-star Electro claymore user from Sumeru who brings a unique blend of **healing, energy regeneration, and Electro application** to her team. With her merchant flair and an eccentric personality, Dori operates a bit differently from other Electro characters by focusing more on **support and utility** rather than raw damage. Her playstyle centers around setting up sustained energy and healing support through her Burst, making her especially useful in **energy-hungry teams** or with characters who benefit from off-field Electro application. While her mechanics may seem unconventional at first, Dori can be a valuable support in the right setups. Her **Elemental Skill, Spirit-Warding Lamp: Troubleshooter Cannon**, fires a projectile that splits upon impact, dealing AoE Electro damage and generating energy particles when it hits enemies. This is a straightforward part of her kit, but it's important for both energy generation and consistent Electro application. The Skill scales with her attack, but for most support builds, you won't focus on its damage\u2014its real value lies in its ability to trigger reactions like Overload, Superconduct, or Electro-Charged when needed, especially with characters who apply other elements off-field. The true centerpiece of Dori\u2019s kit is her **Elemental Burst, Alcazarzaray\u2019s Exactitude**, which summons the **Jinni**, a magical spirit that connects to the active character via a tether. While this tether is active, the Jinni periodically **heals the active character and regenerates energy**, based on Dori\u2019s max HP and Energy Recharge. The connection also applies Electro at intervals, enabling reactions even while you're focused on healing or other abilities. This makes Dori an excellent choice for **sustained healing and batterying**, especially for characters who struggle to maintain their Burst uptime. The Electro application is a bonus, but it can be valuable in reaction-based teams like Hyperbloom, especially in lower-pressure content or overworld exploration. In terms of team composition, Dori is a flexible support for teams that lack energy or consistent healing. She works well with **characters like Cyno, Beidou, or Yae Miko**, who need constant energy input to fuel their high-cost Bursts. In reaction-based teams, such as **Hyperbloom (Dendro + Hydro + Electro)** or **Aggravate**, she can fill the support role by applying Electro and keeping the team healthy while freeing other units to focus on damage. Dori can also pair with characters like **Raiden Shogun**, who may not need healing but benefit from additional Electro energy particles. Although her Electro application isn\u2019t fast enough for high-end reaction spam, it\u2019s consistent enough for most casual and mid-level teams. Dori\u2019s **best artifact set** is typically the **Noblesse Oblige (4-piece)**, which provides a team-wide ATK buff after using her Burst, enhancing her supportive role. If used in reaction teams, a **2-piece Tenacity of the Millelith + 2-piece Maiden Beloved** or **2-piece HP% + 2-piece ER%** setup can also work depending on whether you\u2019re focusing more on healing, survivability, or energy. For main stats, you\u2019ll want **HP% on Sands**, **HP% or Electro DMG Bonus on the Goblet** depending on whether you're applying reactions or focusing on healing, and **Healing Bonus or HP% on the Circlet**. Sub-stats should prioritize **Energy Recharge**, **HP%**, and a bit of **Elemental Mastery** if you're helping trigger reactions. As for weapons, **Favonius Greatsword** is by far her best four-star option. It offers much-needed **Energy Recharge** and can help battery the entire team when built with enough Crit Rate to reliably trigger its passive. **Sacrificial Greatsword** is another decent choice, allowing her to reset her skill cooldown and generate more energy, although it\u2019s less ideal than Favonius. For budget players, **The Bell** and **Forest Regalia** provide HP and ER respectively, but their passives are much less useful. If you\u2019re aiming to maximize healing, **Katsuragikiri Nagamasa** can also work thanks to its ER stat and support-oriented passive. Dori\u2019s **constellations** help smooth out her support mechanics. At **C1**, she reduces the cooldown of her Skill when Electro reactions are triggered\u2014nice for teams relying on reactions. **C2** makes her Burst easier to use by increasing the duration of the tether and improving her healing efficiency. **C4** boosts her energy generation for the team, and **C6** adds an Elemental Mastery buff for the active character, which is great in Dendro reaction comps like Hyperbloom or Aggravate. Even at **C0**, Dori functions well enough as a healer and battery, though constellations can enhance her synergy with elemental teams. Overall, Dori may not be the first Electro character that comes to mind when building a reaction-heavy or high-damage team, but she offers **excellent value in energy regeneration and healing**, particularly for teams that need sustainability over burst damage. Her kit rewards creative playstyles and shines in teams where survivability and uptime are key concerns. With the right investment and team pairing, Dori can be a surprisingly effective support character who keeps the team powered and healthy while adding a touch of Electro flair."}, {"question": "Tell me about Faruzan", "answer": "Faruzan is a four-star Anemo bow user from Sumeru who serves as a powerful **Anemo support**, specifically designed to enhance the performance of **Anemo DPS characters** like Xiao, Wanderer (Scaramouche), and Heizou. While her personality as a quirky, time-displaced scholar adds flavor and charm, her gameplay centers around **providing Anemo RES shred, Anemo damage buffs, and crowd control**, making her an essential piece in teams that rely on strong Anemo-based damage. Though she requires investment and careful energy management, Faruzan can drastically increase the potential of any Anemo DPS once she is properly built and supported. Her **Elemental Skill, Wind Realm of Nasamjnin**, fires a small Anemo projectile that creates a pressurized collapse, pulling enemies together in a short-range vortex. This crowd control function is similar to Sucrose or Venti\u2019s Skill, but on a smaller scale. After using her Skill, Faruzan enters a \u201cManifest Gale\u201d state, which turns her next aimed shot into a special **Hurricane Arrow**. This charged shot applies her key Anemo debuff to enemies and is required to activate her support mechanics. Although the setup requires more effort than other supports, it's worth it, especially when building around Anemo carries. Her **Elemental Burst, The Wind\u2019s Secret Ways**, is where Faruzan\u2019s true support potential is unlocked. It creates a Dazzling Polyhedron that moves in a triangle pattern, intermittently inflicting AoE Anemo damage and applying **Anemo RES reduction** to enemies while **buffing Anemo DMG** for her teammates. This is an extremely rare and valuable support effect, especially because it stacks multiplicatively with other damage sources and buffs. Her Burst allows Anemo characters to reach new damage ceilings, making her irreplaceable in mono-Anemo or plunge-focused teams like Xiao\u2019s. Team-wise, Faruzan is best when **paired with strong Anemo DPS units**, particularly **Xiao**, who relies on external Anemo buffs and resistance shred to reach his full potential. With Faruzan\u2019s buffs, Xiao\u2019s plunge damage gets a massive boost. Similarly, she pairs wonderfully with **Wanderer**, who benefits from her Anemo DMG buffs and grouping capabilities. In teams with **Heizou**, she also provides crowd control and damage amplification. Since Faruzan\u2019s buffs are specific to Anemo damage, she doesn't provide much value outside of Anemo-focused comps, and so she\u2019s not a general support for all team types. However, within her niche, she is arguably the best. Energy recharge is a critical part of Faruzan\u2019s build, as her Burst is quite costly at **80 energy**, and her personal particle generation is low. Because of this, she usually needs an **Energy Recharge Sands**, an **ER-focused weapon**, or a **battery teammate** to consistently cast her Burst every rotation. When she has enough ER, her buffs can be applied seamlessly in short rotations, dramatically improving team performance. It\u2019s often helpful to run her with another Anemo unit like Jean or Sucrose to generate energy for her. For artifacts, Faruzan typically uses the **Noblesse Oblige (4-piece)** set to provide an ATK buff to the team after her Burst and increase her Burst damage, or she can use **The Exile (4-piece)** for added energy regeneration in more supportive builds. Some players also run a **2-piece Viridescent Venerer + 2-piece Emblem of Severed Fate** setup to balance Anemo DMG and ER. Main stats should focus on **Energy Recharge Sands**, **Anemo DMG Bonus Goblet**, and **Crit Rate or Crit DMG Circlet** if you\u2019re trying to scale her personal damage slightly, but ER and HP/utility stats are often preferred if she\u2019s played purely for support. Sub-stats should always prioritize Energy Recharge until her Burst is comfortably up every rotation. For weapons, Faruzan benefits most from **Energy Recharge bows**, especially if she's at low constellation levels. **Favonius Warbow** is a fantastic option, as it generates extra particles for the whole team. **Elegy for the End**, a five-star bow, is also excellent\u2014it not only gives her ER but adds a team-wide EM and ATK buff that fits nicely into most Anemo-centric teams. **Sacrificial Bow** can also be decent to allow more frequent Skill usage, but the extra Hurricane Arrows are rarely needed once her Burst is up reliably. Faruzan\u2019s **constellations** significantly improve her quality of life and support performance. At **C2**, she gains more energy regeneration, which directly fixes part of her biggest flaw. **C4** increases the duration of her debuffs, allowing for smoother team rotations. Her **C6** is transformative\u2014it provides **massive Crit DMG bonuses for Anemo characters**, turning her into a true enabler for top-tier damage output. While she can function at **C0** with heavy energy investment, she becomes significantly more comfortable to use at **C2+**, and at **C6**, she\u2019s one of the best Anemo buffers in the game. In summary, Faruzan is a specialized, high-value support unit designed for Anemo main DPS characters. With the ability to shred Anemo resistance, increase Anemo damage, and provide mild crowd control, she transforms characters like Xiao and Wanderer from good to great. While she has notable energy issues that must be managed and a bit of setup with her skill rotation, the payoff is immense. For players who enjoy investing in Anemo-centric teams and want to see their favorite Anemo carries reach their full potential, Faruzan is not just useful\u2014she\u2019s essential."}, {"question": "Tell me about Furina", "answer": "Furina is a five-star Hydro sword user from Fontaine and serves as both an elegant performer and a powerful off-field support or sub-DPS with unique mechanics that revolve around **HP fluctuations** in the team. As the Hydro Archon, Furina brings a flamboyant and theatrical flair to combat, making her playstyle not only distinct in theme but also in function. Unlike most Hydro units who specialize in healing or Hydro application, Furina\u2019s strength lies in her ability to **convert HP changes into damage** and team-wide buffs, making her one of the most versatile and impactful supports in Genshin Impact. Her kit scales primarily with **max HP and team HP changes**, rewarding players who can balance healing and HP loss in creative ways. Furina\u2019s **Elemental Skill, Salon Solitaire**, switches between two modes depending on whether your team is above or below 50% HP. When her team is healthy, she summons three little spirits called the Salon Members\u2014Gentilhomme, Surintendante, and Mademoiselle\u2014that attack enemies with coordinated Hydro strikes, dealing off-field damage over time and enabling Hydro-related reactions like Vaporize or Bloom. When the active character\u2019s HP is below 50%, these spirits instead cheer and consume HP from your team to boost their damage output. This dynamic shift allows Furina to scale her own damage while also creating synergy with healers who can restore lost HP efficiently. This dance of draining and restoring HP is the core rhythm of her gameplay. Her **Elemental Burst, Let the People Rejoice**, transforms her into a powerful buffer. Upon use, Furina enters a state where she provides a flat **damage bonus to the entire team** based on how much the HP of team members has changed (both healed and lost) over a short period. The more HP fluctuation occurs during this window, the stronger the bonus becomes. This makes her an incredible enabler for characters who deal high damage over time or burst within a short rotation window. Since her Burst benefits from HP changes rather than just loss or gain, Furina works best in teams where HP is actively being drained and restored, whether by her own skill, characters with HP costs, or consistent healers. Furina is most impactful when paired with **strong healers** or **HP-interactive characters**. Units like **Baizhu, Kokomi, Jean, or Charlotte** provide the healing needed to sustain the HP loss Furina generates and maintain uptime on her buffs. Characters like **Neuvillette**, who convert HP loss into damage, also synergize beautifully with Furina since her kit can fuel his mechanics while he restores HP himself. In hypercarry setups, Furina acts as both an off-field Hydro applier and a damage amplifier, supporting main DPS units like **Navia, Ayaka, or Alhaitham** with buffs that scale quickly once the right team conditions are met. Her ability to boost the entire team's output makes her one of the most flexible support characters, whether in mono-Hydro, reaction, or mixed-element teams. For artifacts, Furina\u2019s best-in-slot is the **Golden Troupe (4-piece)**, which dramatically boosts her off-field Elemental Skill damage, especially when she\u2019s not on the field. This set fully capitalizes on her Salon Members\u2019 Hydro attacks and maximizes her supportive damage contribution. However, if you\u2019re using her more for her buffing potential than damage, a **2-piece Tenacity of the Millelith + 2-piece HP% set** or **2-piece Emblem of Severed Fate + HP%** can be used to increase Burst uptime and buff strength. Main stats should prioritize **HP% Sands**, **Hydro DMG Bonus Goblet**, and **Crit Rate or Crit DMG Circlet** (if you're scaling her personal damage), or more HP% if focusing purely on her support role. Sub-stats should aim for HP%, Energy Recharge, and Crit stats. When it comes to weapons, Furina\u2019s signature sword, **Splendor of Tranquil Waters**, is her best option, providing Crit DMG and a passive that enhances her damage and buffing based on HP fluctuation\u2014perfectly designed for her kit. Among five-star alternatives, **Primordial Jade Cutter** works well thanks to its Crit Rate and HP synergy. For four-star weapons, **Festering Desire** boosts her Elemental Skill damage and Energy Recharge, while **Favonius Sword** helps ensure her Burst is always ready, especially in energy-hungry comps. **Sacrificial Sword** can be a decent budget pick if you want more Skill uptime, though she doesn\u2019t benefit as much from Skill resets as other sword users. Furina\u2019s **constellations** significantly enhance her performance, especially if you're using her in high-end content. **C1** removes the HP condition from her skill, allowing both modes to function simultaneously and improving overall consistency. **C2** increases her HP and boosts her damage even further. **C4** enhances her healing and buffs when HP is restored, while **C6** is an absolute game-changer\u2014it grants her the ability to provide massive team-wide buffs and adds a huge personal damage bonus, turning her into a quasi-DPS in her own right. Still, she is already incredibly powerful at **C0**, and most players will find that she performs beautifully without needing constellations. Overall, Furina is a brilliantly designed and thematically rich character who redefines what a Hydro support can be. She combines elegant off-field damage, HP-based buffing, and team-wide synergy into a seamless kit that rewards strategic play and thoughtful team building. Whether you\u2019re weaving her into reaction-based teams or building around HP fluctuation mechanics, Furina elevates both damage and aesthetic flair to a new level. For players who enjoy dynamic support roles, flexible Hydro application, and watching the battlefield shift like a theatrical performance, Furina is easily one of the most compelling and valuable units in Genshin Impact."}, {"question": "Tell me about Ganyu", "answer": "Ganyu is a five-star Cryo bow user from Liyue who stands as one of the most powerful and versatile DPS units in Genshin Impact. Known for her serene personality and hardworking nature as the secretary to the Liyue Qixing, Ganyu\u2019s combat style is elegant, deliberate, and incredibly effective. Her true strength lies in her **charged attacks**, which unleash devastating AoE Cryo damage that can wipe out enemies from a safe distance. Whether built as a freeze-based support or a main DPS, Ganyu offers consistent, high-damage output with minimal cooldown downtime, making her an exceptional choice for players who value precision and sustained performance. Ganyu\u2019s playstyle revolves around her **Charged Attack: Frostflake Arrow**, which, after a brief wind-up, fires a powerful Cryo arrow that explodes on impact, dealing AoE Cryo damage. This is her primary source of damage in a typical DPS build. The Frostflake Arrow scales exceptionally well with both attack and Crit stats, and its AoE effect allows her to deal with both single-target enemies and clustered mobs effectively. Ganyu\u2019s damage ramps up when she strings together a series of these charged shots, especially when supported by a team that keeps enemies frozen or distracted, allowing her to snipe safely from a distance without interruption. Her **Elemental Skill, Trail of the Qilin**, leaves behind a lotus that taunts enemies and explodes after a short time, dealing AoE Cryo damage. This ability functions both as a distraction and a source of energy, creating breathing room for Ganyu to charge her Frostflake Arrows without being interrupted. It\u2019s also a helpful tool for managing aggro during difficult fights or crowd control situations. Her **Elemental Burst, Celestial Shower**, summons a Cryo storm that rains down icicles over a wide area, applying constant Cryo damage to enemies within its radius. This is especially powerful in **Freeze teams**, where enemies can be immobilized under the storm, making it one of the most effective area denial tools in the game. Team-wise, Ganyu shines in both **Freeze** and **Melt** comps. In Freeze teams, pairing her with Hydro characters like **Mona, Kokomi, or Xingqiu** allows her to keep enemies locked in place while she safely unloads her Frostflake Arrows. **Venti** or **Kazuha** can group enemies together and provide Cryo resistance shred via the Viridescent Venerer set, which greatly boosts her overall damage. This setup is extremely effective in Spiral Abyss, where crowd control and sustained AoE damage dominate. Alternatively, Ganyu can be played in **Melt comps**, where characters like **Bennett and Xiangling** provide Pyro application to trigger high-damage Melt reactions from her arrows. Melt Ganyu offers significantly higher burst potential but requires more positioning and reaction timing compared to Freeze teams. For artifacts, Ganyu\u2019s best-in-slot set is **Wanderer\u2019s Troupe (4-piece)**, which boosts her Charged Attack damage and Elemental Mastery\u2014perfect for amplifying both raw Cryo damage and Melt reaction damage. In Freeze comps where EM isn\u2019t as critical, **Blizzard Strayer (4-piece)** is exceptional, granting Crit Rate against frozen enemies and additional Cryo DMG Bonus. It also synergizes beautifully with Cryo resonance and makes Crit stat management much easier. As for main stats, focus on **ATK% Sands**, **Cryo DMG Bonus Goblet**, and **Crit DMG or Crit Rate Circlet**, depending on weapon and set choices. Sub-stats should target Crit stats, ATK%, and Elemental Mastery if using Melt builds. Ganyu\u2019s best weapons vary slightly depending on build, but **Amos\u2019 Bow** is her undisputed best-in-slot for general use, enhancing both normal and charged attacks significantly the longer the arrow travels, which synergizes perfectly with her Frostflake Arrows. Other five-star options like **Aqua Simulacra** or **Polar Star** offer high Crit stats and damage buffs that also work well. Among four-star bows, **Prototype Crescent** (craftable) is surprisingly strong when used correctly\u2014if you hit a weak spot, it grants a large ATK buff. **Hamayumi** is another strong free-to-play option that boosts charged attack damage when Ganyu\u2019s energy is full, making it a natural fit for her playstyle. Ganyu is already incredible at **C0**, but her **constellations** further refine her potential. **C1** gives her an extra Frostflake Arrow without needing to charge again, which is a nice quality-of-life improvement. **C2** boosts energy generation and allows her Burst to support the team more effectively. **C4** and **C6** are significant spikes, with C6 drastically reducing enemy Cryo resistance and enabling her to fire arrows without charge time, which turns her into a rapid-fire machine gun of Cryo damage. However, she doesn\u2019t rely on constellations to excel\u2014her power is readily accessible even at base level with proper investment. In conclusion, Ganyu is a top-tier Cryo DPS with a graceful yet deadly playstyle centered around precision and high damage per shot. Whether you prefer locking enemies down with constant Freeze or pushing out massive Melt numbers, Ganyu adapts beautifully to both styles. She\u2019s a long-range powerhouse who rewards patient, accurate players and provides immense value in both open-world and high-end content like the Abyss. If you\u2019re looking for a main DPS that combines elegance, control, and overwhelming Cryo damage, Ganyu is one of the strongest and most rewarding characters in the game."}, {"question": "Tell me about Keqing", "answer": "Keqing is a five-star Electro sword user from Liyue who excels as a fast-paced, precision-based main DPS, offering a highly agile and responsive combat style. She\u2019s known for her quick strikes, rapid repositioning, and elegant swordplay, with a kit that rewards players who enjoy speed and versatility in combat. While she was often considered underwhelming compared to other top-tier DPS units in the early days of Genshin, the introduction of **Dendro reactions**, especially **Aggravate**, has revitalized her performance and secured her a place in powerful team comps. Whether you build her as a traditional Electro DPS or opt into physical or hybrid builds, Keqing brings fluid mechanics and flashy mobility that make her a fun and stylish character to master. Her **Elemental Skill, Stellar Restoration**, is the heart of her identity. It allows her to throw a Lightning Stiletto that can either deal AoE Electro damage on impact or teleport her to the mark when pressed again, triggering an additional AoE Electro slash. This teleportation gives Keqing unmatched battlefield mobility, letting her dodge attacks, reposition mid-combo, or chase down enemies instantly. If the Skill is followed up by a Charged Attack instead of teleporting, it also converts the damage into Electro, enabling her to continuously apply Electro for reaction setups. This gives her flexibility in how she plays, and at higher skill levels, good Keqing players weave their combos to flow smoothly between teleportation and charged strikes. Her **Elemental Burst, Starward Sword**, delivers a quick series of Electro slashes in a wide AoE followed by a finishing strike. It scales off her ATK and deals consistent Electro damage, making it a solid burst tool to clear mobs or chunk down elite enemies. While her Burst isn\u2019t the flashiest in terms of multipliers, it has a low energy cost and short animation, allowing her to get back into the fight quickly. It fits perfectly into her playstyle, where she cycles between quick rotations of skill, normal attacks, and bursts without breaking momentum. In terms of team building, Keqing now finds a powerful niche in **Aggravate teams**, where Electro is amplified by Dendro. Pairing her with Dendro applicators like **Nahida, Baizhu, Yaoyao, or Collei** opens up access to high-frequency, high-scaling Aggravate procs that elevate her damage significantly. Add an Electro support like **Fischl** or **Kuki Shinobu** for additional energy and Electro particles, and you've got a well-rounded team that enables Keqing to stay on-field and dish out non-stop reactions. Alternatively, she can still function in **Electro-Charged** or **mono-Electro teams** with units like Yae Miko and Beidou, although those comps are a bit less optimal in today\u2019s meta. Some players even opt for **physical Keqing** with Cryo supports like Rosaria and superconduct setups, though that route has generally fallen out of favor compared to her Dendro synergy. Keqing\u2019s best artifact set in Aggravate-focused builds is **Thundering Fury (4-piece)**, which increases Aggravate damage and reduces her Skill cooldown, letting her use Stellar Restoration more often for higher uptime and damage. Alternatively, **Gilded Dreams (4-piece)** is strong if you're focusing more on Elemental Mastery scaling and triggering reactions. For a more general Electro build, **2-piece Thundering Fury + 2-piece Gladiator\u2019s Finale** or **Shimenawa\u2019s Reminiscence** also works. Main stats should focus on **ATK% or Elemental Mastery Sands**, **Electro DMG Goblet**, and **Crit Rate/Crit DMG Circlet**, depending on your weapon and stat balance. Sub-stats should prioritize Crit Rate, Crit Damage, EM (for Aggravate builds), and ATK%. Weapon-wise, Keqing\u2019s best-in-slot is **Mistsplitter Reforged**, which offers Crit DMG and Elemental DMG bonuses that perfectly match her fast-paced Electro playstyle. Other excellent five-star swords include **Primordial Jade Cutter** for a Crit Rate boost and HP scaling, or **Haran Geppaku Futsu** if you\u2019re focusing on normal attack damage. For four-star options, **Lion\u2019s Roar** is fantastic in Electro-Charged or Aggravate teams, providing a strong damage bonus against Electro-affected enemies. **Black Sword** is another solid pick, especially if you're going the Crit-heavy route, and **Iron Sting** is a solid free-to-play option that increases Elemental Mastery for reaction-focused builds. Keqing\u2019s constellations offer incremental improvements but aren\u2019t necessary for her to be effective. **C1** increases her Energy Recharge, making her Burst more consistent. **C2** and **C4** provide more attack bonuses and survivability. Her biggest spike comes at **C6**, where her Electro-infused attacks get a 6-second damage boost after using her Skill, allowing her to dish out sustained high damage in longer fights. However, she performs well even at C0\u2014especially in Aggravate teams\u2014and doesn\u2019t require constellations to be strong. In summary, Keqing is a stylish and dynamic Electro DPS who thrives in fast-paced, reaction-heavy teams. Her unique blend of teleportation, rapid attacks, and elemental flexibility makes her incredibly engaging to play. While she was once seen as a flashy but underwhelming unit, the rise of Dendro and Aggravate has given her a second life in the meta. For players who enjoy quick decision-making, rapid rotations, and elegant swordplay, Keqing is one of the most satisfying characters to build and master in Genshin Impact."}, {"question": "Tell me about Klee", "answer": "Klee is a five-star Pyro catalyst user from Mondstadt who brings a unique, explosive playstyle that blends high single-target damage with chaotic AoE bursts. Known for her childlike innocence and destructive tendencies, Klee is a high-risk, high-reward character who demands a bit of mechanical finesse but rewards players with incredible Pyro damage potential when used properly. Unlike more straightforward DPS units, Klee\u2019s kit involves a rhythm of timed Normal Attacks, careful stamina management, and smart use of her skill and burst to keep enemies juggled and burning. She shines as a **main on-field Pyro DPS**, and her kit scales primarily with her ATK and Pyro DMG, making her build fairly straightforward but execution-dependent. Klee\u2019s Normal Attack throws bouncing bombs that deal Pyro damage, and every third attack releases a charged mine that explodes shortly after contact. These attacks form the core of her playstyle and are deceptively powerful, especially when animation-cancelled efficiently. Her **Elemental Skill, Jumpy Dumpty**, throws a bouncing bomb that bounces three times and splits into mines on impact. These mines persist for a few seconds before exploding, allowing you to set traps or trigger chain reactions. It\u2019s her main source of energy generation and can be used both offensively and tactically to control space. Smart players will learn to throw Jumpy Dumpties just ahead of groups of enemies to capitalize on both the bounce damage and mine detonation. Klee\u2019s **Elemental Burst, Sparks \u2018n\u2019 Splash**, summons a barrage of homing Pyro sparks that attack nearby enemies automatically while she remains on-field. It\u2019s an incredible source of consistent Pyro application and passive damage that complements her fast-paced fighting style. However, the burst is canceled if she leaves the field, so timing is crucial\u2014ideally, you want to use it when you're ready to commit to her for a full rotation. This creates a very \u201csticky\u201d DPS loop: once you pop her Burst, you\u2019ll want to stay on Klee until it's done to maximize damage. Her passive talents also support her kit well, with bonuses to Charged Attack Crit Rate and energy regeneration when triggering Pyro reactions, making her an excellent enabler for overload, vaporize, and melt-based teams. Klee fits best in **reaction-focused teams** that can capitalize on her rapid Pyro application. For Vaporize setups, Hydro appliers like Xingqiu, Yelan, or Kokomi are ideal\u2014they allow her to consistently trigger Vaporize with her Normal and Charged Attacks for huge damage. For Overload or Aggravate-style comps, Electro supports like Fischl, Beidou, or Raiden can add energy and damage while helping keep enemies staggered. Klee can also work in mono-Pyro or Melt teams with support from Bennett, Xiangling, and Rosaria, depending on what role you want her to fill. However, she benefits greatly from **shields and healing**, since her short range and squishy nature make her vulnerable during combat\u2014shielders like Zhongli or healers like Bennett/Kokomi help keep her alive and on-field longer. For artifacts, Klee\u2019s best-in-slot is **Crimson Witch of Flames** (4-piece), which enhances both her Pyro DMG and reaction damage, especially Vaporize and Overload. It complements her kit perfectly and scales extremely well with reaction-based gameplay. If you\u2019re still farming or experimenting, a 2-piece combination of Crimson Witch and either Gladiator\u2019s Finale or Shimenawa\u2019s Reminiscence (for extra ATK%) can work as a placeholder. Main stats should focus on **ATK% or Energy Recharge Sands**, **Pyro DMG Goblet**, and **Crit Rate or Crit DMG Circlet**, depending on her weapon and your sub-stat balance. Sub-stats should prioritize Crit, ATK%, and some Energy Recharge for smoother burst uptime. Weapon-wise, Klee has a few excellent choices. Her signature five-star weapon, **Lost Prayer to the Sacred Winds**, is an amazing fit for her\u2014offering high Crit Rate, elemental damage scaling, and a passive that rewards staying on-field, which synergizes with her burst and DPS playstyle. **The Widsith** is a phenomenal four-star option, giving huge random buffs to either ATK, Elemental DMG, or Elemental Mastery, all of which benefit her kit. **Solar Pearl** is another good four-star catalyst for Battle Pass users, offering balanced Crit Rate and decent scaling for both Normal Attacks and Elemental Skills. For a more budget option, **Mappa Mare** is a craftable catalyst that increases elemental damage after triggering reactions and can be solid early on. Her constellations are strong, though not necessary to enjoy her. **C1** reduces the cooldown of her Elemental Skill, giving her more consistent energy and mine usage, while **C2** boosts her energy regeneration and Crit Rate. **C4** offers defensive utility by reducing enemy DEF, and **C6** is an enormous spike in power, granting her a guaranteed crit after using her Burst and significantly amping up her reaction potential. While she functions well at C0, each constellation noticeably smooths out her rotations and raises her ceiling, especially if you want to use her in Spiral Abyss or harder content. In summary, Klee is a powerful, high-octane Pyro DPS who rewards aggressive, smart play with a blend of AoE and single-target destruction. Her kit is both playful and precise, making her ideal for players who enjoy mastering a character\u2019s rhythm and using positioning and timing to deal massive damage. While she can feel a bit squishy or chaotic in the hands of beginners, players who stick with her and learn to optimize her burst windows, reactions, and animation cancels will find one of the most explosive and satisfying damage dealers in Genshin Impact."}, {"question": "Tell me about Sara", "answer": "Kujou Sara is a four-star Electro bow user from Inazuma, serving as both an Electro support and buffer with a militaristic, no-nonsense demeanor that reflects her role as a general of the Tenryou Commission. While she\u2019s often compared to Bennett for her buffing utility, Sara\u2019s playstyle and niche are quite distinct. She shines best when built and played specifically to **amplify the burst damage of Electro characters**, particularly those who rely on attack scaling. Her unique role as a buffer and Electro enabler makes her a valuable asset in specific team comps, especially with characters like Raiden Shogun, Yae Miko, or even Fischl when used in burst-oriented setups. Sara\u2019s playstyle revolves heavily around her **Elemental Skill, Tengu Stormcall**, which grants a **Crowfeather buff** to her next charged shot. When this charged shot hits an enemy, it creates an AoE explosion that not only deals Electro damage but also grants an **Attack Bonus** to characters within its area, scaling with Sara\u2019s base attack. The trick to playing Sara effectively is to quickly use her skill, fire a charged shot to deploy the Crowfeather, and then immediately switch to your main DPS to receive the buff and strike while it's active. Timing and placement are key, as the buff only lasts for a few seconds and affects characters who are inside the area of the feather\u2019s explosion when it lands. Her **Elemental Burst, Subjugation: Koukou Sendou**, calls down a massive bolt of lightning in a wide AoE, dealing Electro damage and applying the Crowfeather Attack Bonus to characters caught in the field. This makes her Burst an excellent tool for **teamwide buffing**, especially when it overlaps with the DPS's own burst rotations. At higher constellations, particularly **C2 and C6**, her burst becomes much more potent\u2014adding extra bolts of lightning and enhancing Electro Crit Damage for allies, which turns her into a core part of some of the strongest Raiden or Yae Miko teams. Without those constellations, she\u2019s still effective, but requires more careful rotation management to maximize her contribution. Sara fits best into **Electro-centric teams** where she can support a strong Electro DPS or sub-DPS. The most notable synergy is with **Raiden Shogun**, as Sara\u2019s Attack Buff greatly enhances Raiden\u2019s Burst damage, especially when both are at higher constellations. Other strong partners include **Yae Miko**, who benefits from the additional Attack and Electro Crit Damage at C6, and **Keqing**, who can capitalize on the buffed Electro hits. While she can technically buff non-Electro characters, her kit and constellations are clearly designed to support Electro damage specifically, so her optimal use case lies within teams that lean heavily into the Electro element. Adding a **battery like Fischl** or a **shield/healer like Zhongli or Kokomi** can also help cover her weaknesses and ensure smooth rotations. In terms of artifacts, Sara performs best with the **Noblesse Oblige** set, as it boosts her Burst damage and provides a teamwide Attack buff after using her Burst\u2014stacking with her existing buffs. This helps her offer even more support value in short, burst-focused rotations. Alternatively, if you\u2019re using her mostly for her skill buffs, you could consider a **2-piece combination of Emblem of Severed Fate and Noblesse** for energy and burst effectiveness. For main stats, focus on **Energy Recharge on Sands**, **Electro Damage Bonus on Goblet**, and **Crit Rate or Crit Damage on Circlet** to allow her to deal some respectable personal damage while maintaining her support role. Sub-stats should prioritize Energy Recharge (as her Burst is relatively expensive), Crit stats, and maybe some flat ATK to buff her output. Weapon-wise, Sara benefits most from bows that boost her **base attack**, since her Attack Bonus scales directly off of that. **Skyward Harp** is one of her best 5-star options, giving both a high base ATK and Crit stats. Among four-star bows, **Alley Hunter** and **Sacrificial Bow** are strong picks, the former boosting her damage while the latter gives her a second skill use to ease energy issues. **Favonius Warbow** is a great energy-supportive choice that also provides particles for the team, especially if your Sara isn\u2019t at high constellations and you need her Burst on cooldown. Her constellations make a huge difference. While **C1 and C2** improve her energy and burst consistency, **C6 is a massive power spike**\u2014granting **Electro Crit Damage to all allies** within her buff zone, effectively supercharging any Electro DPS\u2019s burst potential. This makes her one of the best supports for Raiden at C6, but even at **C2**, she\u2019s already significantly better at her job and feels smoother to play. Overall, Kujou Sara is a specialized but extremely potent buffer for Electro damage dealers. She takes a bit of mechanical understanding and practice to play well, especially in terms of positioning and timing, but when executed properly, she can skyrocket your Electro DPS\u2019s damage to new heights. If you\u2019re investing in an Electro-heavy team, particularly one centered around Raiden or Yae, Sara is not just a good addition\u2014she\u2019s one of the best possible supports for enabling their full potential."}, {"question": "Tell me about Mualani", "answer": "Mualani is a five-star Hydro catalyst user from Natlan who brings a refreshing, high-energy playstyle centered around mobility and powerful HP-scaling damage. Unlike many catalyst users who focus on long-range elemental application or off-field support, Mualani is designed to be a full-on **on-field DPS**, surfing atop her shark companion, Sharky, and tearing through enemies with flashy, water-powered strikes. Her kit rewards players who enjoy fast-paced, agile combat with a focus on weaving skill-based mechanics and managing momentum for explosive payoff. She\u2019s especially well-suited to players who want to ride the wave\u2014literally and figuratively\u2014while bringing heavy AoE damage and a fun, animated combat style. Her Elemental Skill, *Surfshark Wavebreaker*, is the core of her gameplay. When activated, Mualani hops onto Sharky and begins surfing around the battlefield. While riding Sharky, her Normal Attacks are transformed into Hydro-infused melee strikes called Sharky\u2019s Bites. Each bite applies a Marked as Prey debuff to enemies and builds stacks of Wave Momentum. Once she reaches three stacks, her next attack is upgraded to a *Surging Bite*, a high-damage Hydro slash that not only deals AoE damage but also sends out homing Shark Missiles to any marked enemies nearby. This creates a highly interactive loop of mobility, positioning, and burst windows that encourages the player to stay engaged and constantly moving. Her Skill also gives her interruption resistance, but it\u2019s not perfect\u2014players should be mindful of strong hits that could knock her off Sharky mid-combo. Her Elemental Burst, *Boomsharka-laka*, is an explosive AoE Hydro attack that deals massive damage in a wide radius and spawns Sourcewater Droplets\u2014essential for keeping her momentum going. The Burst scales with her Max HP, like her other abilities, and benefits greatly from her built-up momentum and enemy marks. It\u2019s particularly effective for clearing grouped mobs or taking a big chunk out of tougher enemies after setting up with her Skill. Mualani\u2019s passive talents help her maintain this momentum by increasing her energy regeneration and damage based on Wave Momentum and Prey Marks, making her rotations feel fluid and rewarding once you get the hang of her flow. When it comes to teams, Mualani thrives in compositions that can **protect her during Sharky\u2019s ride** and enable reactions to boost her damage. Shielders like Zhongli or Baizhu are incredibly helpful for preventing interruptions, which is crucial for maintaining her momentum. Off-field Pyro or Electro characters like Fischl, Xiangling, or even Yae Miko allow her to trigger Vaporize or Electro-Charged reactions, increasing her damage significantly. She also benefits from Hydro Resonance, which increases Max HP\u2014a direct buff to all her damage. Pairing her with characters like Kokomi or Furina not only boosts resonance but can also bring off-field healing or buffing that keeps her uptime high and her rotation smooth. For artifacts, Mualani\u2019s best-in-slot set is **Marechaussee Hunter**, which boosts her Normal and Charged Attack damage while giving her a Crit Rate increase when her HP changes\u2014a condition she triggers naturally through her playstyle. This set perfectly matches her kit and makes her DPS much more consistent. If you\u2019re still farming or want a placeholder, a mix of HP% and Hydro DMG bonus sets like **Tenacity of the Millelith** and **Heart of Depth** can be viable. Main stats should focus on **HP% on Sands**, **Hydro Damage Bonus on Goblet**, and **Crit Rate or Crit Damage on Circlet**, depending on your weapon and sub-stat balance. Sub-stats should prioritize HP%, Crit stats, and a touch of Energy Recharge for smoother Burst access. Mualani\u2019s best weapon is her signature five-star catalyst, **Flowing Purity**, which gives her HP% and passive effects that boost her skill and burst damage. It\u2019s tailor-made for her and amplifies her core mechanics seamlessly. Among four-star options, **Prototype Amber** is a decent free-to-play alternative that boosts HP% and energy regeneration, though it lacks offensive potential. **The Widsith** is also surprisingly strong for short-term damage spikes, especially if the buff lines up with her burst window. For players on a budget or just starting, **Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers** can provide situational value if she\u2019s paired with a stronger main carry. Her constellations enhance her power and playstyle without making her feel dependent on them. Her **C1** improves her ability to maintain Wave Momentum and slightly boosts her damage output. **C2** reduces cooldowns, letting her spend more time surfing and less time waiting. The real jump comes at **C4**, where her Surging Bites deal even more AoE damage and spawn additional Shark Missiles. Finally, **C6** gives her a full rotation buff, turning her into a near-unstoppable Hydro force with greatly enhanced damage and sustain. While she\u2019s completely viable and fun at C0, her constellations definitely scale her up into higher-end content more comfortably. In short, Mualani is a stylish, surfing DPS with an active playstyle that blends mobility, Hydro damage, and AoE destruction into a fluid and satisfying loop. She\u2019s a great fit for players who enjoy characters with rhythm and tempo, and she brings something new and fun to the Hydro DPS archetype. With the right team and a bit of practice, she becomes an unstoppable wave of destruction\u2014both beautiful and dangerous in equal measure."}, {"question": "Tell me about Neuvillette", "answer": "Neuvillette is a five-star Hydro catalyst user from Fontaine, and he stands out as a unique powerhouse who blends the elegance of Fontaine\u2019s Chief Justice with overwhelming on-field dominance. As a main DPS, Neuvillette commands the battlefield with massive Hydro beams and an incredibly satisfying charge attack mechanic that scales heavily with his HP. He is one of the rare catalyst users who feels like a high-impact carry rather than a support or enabler, capable of dealing tremendous AoE Hydro damage while also offering limited self-healing and visual spectacle with each attack. His playstyle revolves around **charged attacks**, specifically the **Equitable Judgment** beam, which fires a long-range Hydro torrent that pierces through enemies. To unleash this beam, Neuvillette must first **gather Sourcewater Droplets**, which he creates by using his **Elemental Skill, O Tears, I Shall Repay** or by certain team interactions. His Skill summons a wave of Hydro damage that knocks enemies back and creates droplets upon hitting. These droplets restore his stamina and charge, allowing him to fire his devastating charged attack without consuming stamina or health. This loop of using his Skill and charged attack creates a rhythm where Neuvillette constantly weaves in abilities to maintain uptime on his beams. His **Elemental Burst, O Tides, I Have Returned**, is a high-damage AoE Hydro slam that summons a massive cascade of water, dealing damage and spawning additional Sourcewater Droplets. It has a surprisingly short cooldown and low energy cost for how impactful it feels, making it a great tool for clearing large groups or bursting down tougher foes. What sets Neuvillette apart, however, is that **his charged beam damage scales entirely off his max HP**, making HP% his most valuable stat, and allowing for tanky, high-damage builds that don\u2019t compromise survivability. In terms of team composition, Neuvillette performs best when **he is the on-field Hydro DPS**, supported by off-field characters who can either generate reactions or buff his damage. He thrives in **Mono Hydro** setups with characters like Furina, Kokomi, or Yelan, who boost his damage while sustaining or generating energy. Alternatively, **Electro-Charged** teams with Fischl or Beidou can work well, and **Freeze** setups are possible with Cryo supports like Rosaria or Layla, who provide consistent Cryo without stealing field time. Crucially, Neuvillette does not want to be interrupted while channeling his beam, so **shielders like Zhongli or Baizhu** are top-tier pairings to prevent stagger and keep his DPS flowing smoothly. Artifact-wise, Neuvillette\u2019s best set is **Marechaussee Hunter**, which is tailored to him. It increases Normal and Charged Attack damage and gives a Crit Rate boost when HP fluctuates\u2014perfectly matching his self-healing mechanics and HP-scaling beam playstyle. Alternatively, if Marechaussee isn\u2019t available, a mix of **Heart of Depth** and **Tenacity of the Millelith** or **2pc HP%** sets can work. For main stats, you\u2019ll want **HP% on Sands**, **Hydro Damage Bonus on Goblet**, and **Crit Rate or Crit Damage on Circlet** depending on your weapon and overall stat balance. Sub-stats should focus on HP%, Crit stats, and a bit of Energy Recharge for more consistent Burst uptime. As for weapons, Neuvillette\u2019s signature catalyst, **Tome of the Eternal Flow**, is his best-in-slot by a wide margin, offering HP%, Crit Damage, and buffs tailored to his charged attack loops. Among four-star options, **The Prototype Amber** is a decent free-to-play choice for sustain and energy, though the damage falls off in harder content. **The Widsith** is another viable pick that gives temporary massive boosts to Crit or Elemental damage, albeit with some RNG. **Sacrificial Jade** from Battle Pass is also strong, providing Crit Rate and an HP bonus, aligning well with his needs. Neuvillette\u2019s constellations are strong but not necessary for him to perform at a high level. Even at **C0**, he is already capable of dominating the field. That said, **C1** smooths out his energy needs and healing uptime, while **C2** greatly improves his charged attack frequency. **C6** is a massive jump, turning him into an even more absurd DPS with damage bonuses and enhanced beam attacks, but most players will find him more than powerful enough without going beyond C1 or C2. Overall, Neuvillette is a cinematic, fluid, and destructive on-field Hydro DPS who rewards proper stat investment and a bit of patience. His charged attack beam melts enemies in wide arcs, and with the right setup, he can clear even the hardest content with grace and force. Whether you\u2019re drawn to his aesthetic, his lore as Fontaine\u2019s moral arbiter, or his unique high-impact playstyle, Neuvillette delivers an incredibly satisfying experience unlike any other character in *Genshin Impact*."}, {"question": "Tell me about QIQI", "answer": "Qiqi is a five-star Cryo sword user from Liyue who serves as a strong, consistent healer with some unique quirks and limitations. She\u2019s best known for her exceptional ability to keep the entire team\u2019s health topped up through both her skills and Normal Attacks. Though her role is primarily as a healer, Qiqi can also act as a Cryo applier in reaction-focused teams\u2014though she\u2019s not the most efficient in that regard due to her lack of energy generation and limited off-field presence. Still, for players who value survivability and want a reliable Cryo healer, Qiqi is a dependable choice. Her healing comes mainly from her **Elemental Skill, Adeptus Art: Herald of Frost**, which summons a floating talisman that follows the active character. This talisman periodically heals based on Qiqi\u2019s ATK and also restores HP whenever the character performs Normal or Charged Attacks. Because of this, Qiqi encourages an active playstyle where your characters are on the field attacking\u2014making her synergize well with melee-focused characters who like to stay active. The healing is substantial and continuous, making her especially effective in teams that don\u2019t want to slow down for healing rotations. Her **Elemental Burst, Preserver of Fortune**, deals a large AoE Cryo strike and applies the **Fortune-Preserving Talisman** to all enemies hit. Characters who hit those marked enemies heal whenever they deal damage to them, making the Burst an emergency full-team heal tool as well as a secondary source of Cryo application. However, the Burst costs 80 energy and Qiqi doesn\u2019t generate much energy herself, which means she often needs an external battery or a lot of Energy Recharge to use it consistently. While her Cryo application is technically constant during her Skill, it\u2019s not as fast or reliable for triggering reactions like Freeze or Superconduct compared to other Cryo supports like Diona or Rosaria. Qiqi fits best in **sustain-focused teams** where you need consistent healing more than strong reactions or energy utility. She pairs decently with Pyro or Electro characters for Melt or Superconduct teams, but she\u2019s more of a reactive element than a proactive enabler. Some players also use her in **physical damage teams**\u2014often with characters like Eula\u2014since she can trigger Superconduct and provide constant healing while those characters deal damage. She\u2019s also a good fit for beginners or exploration teams where healing and survivability are the top priority. Artifact-wise, Qiqi benefits most from the **Ocean-Hued Clam** set, which boosts her healing and deals bonus damage based on how much she heals\u2014giving her at least some offensive presence. If that set isn\u2019t available or desired, a **2-piece ATK% + 2-piece Healing Bonus** setup can work. Main stats should focus on **ATK%** for both Sands and Goblet, and **Healing Bonus** on the Circlet. Since her healing scales entirely off ATK, stacking ATK through sub-stats and weapon choice is the most effective way to maximize her support role. When choosing weapons for Qiqi, **Sacrificial Sword** is a great choice\u2014it allows her to reset her Skill cooldown and maintain nearly 100% uptime on her healing talisman. **Favonius Sword** is another solid option that helps make up for her low Energy generation by providing particles to the team. If you want to maximize her healing, ATK-focused weapons like **Aquila Favonia** or **Amenoma Kageuchi** also work well, as they raise the raw value of her heals and damage. Qiqi\u2019s constellations aren\u2019t game-changing early on, but they do offer some quality-of-life improvements. Constellation 1 allows her Normal and Charged Attacks to occasionally apply the healing talisman from her Burst, which helps maintain healing without needing to use the Burst itself. Her later constellations increase her Cryo damage or boost the ATK of characters affected by her healing, but overall, Qiqi is mostly complete at C0\u2014what you see is what you get. In summary, Qiqi is an ultra-reliable healer with an unusual ATK-scaling kit and a focus on survivability over team utility or elemental reactions. While she lacks synergy with modern meta reactions and can feel energy-hungry in prolonged fights, her healing output is among the best in the game. For players who value raw healing, want to ensure their team never dips low, or simply enjoy her calm aesthetic and story-driven character, Qiqi is a comforting and loyal support who\u2019ll never let your team fall."}, {"question": "Tell me about Heizou", "answer": "Heizou is a four-star Anemo catalyst user from Inazuma who breaks the mold by functioning as a melee brawler despite wielding a catalyst. His fighting style is fast, fluid, and stylish, drawing inspiration from martial arts and detective flair, making him one of the most unique characters in *Genshin Impact*. Unlike most catalyst users who attack from a distance, Heizou punches and kicks with Anemo-infused strikes, allowing him to be played as either an on-field DPS or an elemental reaction-focused support. His kit rewards strategic play and thoughtful reaction timing, especially when it comes to Swirl-based teams. At the heart of Heizou\u2019s playstyle is his **Elemental Skill, Heartstopper Strike**, which charges up stacks called \u201cDeclension\u201d to unleash a powerful strike that deals AoE Anemo damage. Holding the skill allows him to build up to four stacks, and when maxed out, he can trigger a Conviction effect for extra damage. It\u2019s a skill that rewards anticipation and quick decision-making\u2014charging fully gives you more burst, but tapping can be useful in high-speed combat scenarios. His **Elemental Burst, Windmuster Kick**, is a single, stylish flying kick that creates a shockwave of Anemo damage, and it triggers additional Swirl explosions when it reacts with Pyro, Hydro, Cryo, or Electro. This makes Heizou especially potent at setting off multiple reaction-based damage procs in quick succession. Heizou fits most naturally into **Swirl-reaction teams**, where his Anemo abilities can spread elemental statuses and amplify damage through Elemental Mastery scaling. He works exceptionally well with characters that apply consistent off-field elemental damage, such as Xingqiu, Fischl, Xiangling, or Beidou. In these teams, Heizou acts as the on-field driver, rapidly triggering Swirls while dealing high personal damage. Thanks to the Anemo element\u2019s flexibility, he can also be slotted into **Viridescent Venerer** teams to reduce enemy resistance to elements like Pyro or Electro, boosting your main DPS\u2019s effectiveness. Artifact-wise, Heizou\u2019s best set is the **Viridescent Venerer** set. This not only boosts his Swirl damage but also shreds elemental resistance, enhancing the entire team's output. If you\u2019re building him for personal damage, you can consider a two-piece combo like **Viridescent + Gladiator\u2019s Finale** or **Shimenawa\u2019s Reminiscence**, but full Viridescent is almost always more valuable due to its team-wide benefits. His ideal main stats are **Elemental Mastery** or **ATK%** Sands (depending on focus), **Anemo Damage Bonus** on the Goblet, and **Crit Rate or Crit Damage** on the Circlet. If you want to maximize Swirl reaction damage, triple Elemental Mastery works well too. Heizou\u2019s best weapons often depend on whether you\u2019re building him for reaction damage or for raw crit-based DPS. For reaction-focused builds, the **Sacrificial Fragments** or **Maplewood Spear** (if it existed in catalyst form) would be ideal due to high Elemental Mastery. **Solar Pearl** is great for crit-scaling hybrid builds, especially if you\u2019re keeping his Normal Attacks in rotation. **Widsith** is also a very strong option, offering huge bursts of damage when its random buff aligns in your favor. **Dodoco Tales** and **Mappa Mare** can serve as budget options that still perform well in reaction-heavy or free-to-play teams. Heizou\u2019s constellations elevate his performance in interesting ways. His **C1** increases his Elemental Skill's effectiveness and helps him gain Declension stacks faster, improving skill uptime. His **C2** extends the Swirl reaction capability of his Burst, allowing for even more AoE damage through chain reactions. **C4** provides Energy when triggering Swirl, easing his rotation in reaction-heavy teams, and **C6** boosts his CRIT Rate and offers a substantial buff to his Elemental Skill, turning him into a serious contender for main DPS in a well-built team. In essence, Heizou is a fast-paced, reaction-centric brawler who brings a refreshing twist to both catalyst gameplay and Anemo utility. His melee-style combat makes him feel active and engaging, while his potential as a Swirl enabler and debuffer means he can be both stylish and extremely effective. Whether you\u2019re building him to drive a reaction team or simply enjoy his rapid combos and detective aesthetic, Heizou delivers both form and function with flair."}, {"question": "Tell me about Thoma", "answer": "Thoma is a four-star Pyro polearm user from Inazuma who serves as a reliable shielder and support character, best known for his protective abilities and consistent off-field Pyro application. Though not typically used as a main DPS, Thoma finds his niche in teams that benefit from frequent shielding and elemental reactions, particularly in Vaporize, Burgeon, or Overload compositions. His role may be more subtle than that of a damage dealer, but his steady presence on the field and his stylish flame-imbued attacks make him a dependable pick in the right setups. Thoma\u2019s Elemental Skill, **Blazing Blessing**, summons a small Pyro AoE burst while forming a shield based on his max HP. While the initial shield isn\u2019t especially strong compared to characters like Zhongli or Diona, Thoma\u2019s true value comes from his Elemental Burst, **Crimson Ooyoroi**. When activated, this Burst creates a flaming armor effect that triggers additional shields and Pyro damage whenever the active character performs Normal Attacks. These attacks deal coordinated Pyro strikes and refresh Thoma\u2019s shield, allowing him to maintain constant protection and off-field Pyro application throughout the duration of the Burst. In team compositions, Thoma pairs especially well with characters who rely on Normal Attacks or benefit from Pyro reactions. For example, in **Burgeon** teams, Thoma\u2019s off-field Pyro can ignite Dendro Cores created by Hydro and Dendro characters, triggering explosive AoE damage. His shielding also protects teammates from the self-inflicted damage that Burgeon causes. Characters like Nahida and Xingqiu can pair with him to create Dendro and Hydro cores, while Thoma safely detonates them with his Burst. Alternatively, he can serve as a durable Pyro enabler for Normal Attack-focused characters like Yoimiya, especially at higher constellations where he buffs attack speed and improves shield strength. When building Thoma, the **Emblem of Severed Fate** artifact set is widely considered his best-in-slot. It provides Energy Recharge (which he desperately needs due to his high Burst cost) and boosts his Burst damage based on his Energy Recharge stat. If using him in a Burgeon role, a mix of **Flower of Paradise Lost** or **Gilded Dreams** can work well, boosting his Elemental Mastery and thereby increasing his reaction damage. For main stats, prioritize Energy Recharge on the Sands, HP% or EM on the Goblet depending on the role, and HP% or EM again on the Circlet. Sub-stats should focus on Energy Recharge, HP%, and Elemental Mastery. Thoma\u2019s best weapons vary depending on his build. For support and shielding builds, the **Favonius Lance** is excellent due to its energy generation. **The Catch** is also a solid free-to-play option that enhances his Burst and provides some Energy Recharge. If you\u2019re leaning into a Burgeon-focused setup, **Kitain Cross Spear** is an underrated craftable weapon that increases Elemental Mastery and provides energy back after using the Elemental Skill\u2014perfect for reaction-based Thoma. If you\u2019re fortunate enough to have five-star weapons like **Engulfing Lightning**, he can benefit from the massive Energy Recharge and scaling it offers. Thoma\u2019s constellations offer substantial improvements to his utility and team synergy. Constellation 1 increases his shield strength and grants additional energy, helping with his rotation consistency. Constellation 4 boosts the Normal Attack damage of characters under his flaming armor, enhancing synergy with characters like Yoimiya. His Constellation 6 is a major turning point\u2014it grants all party members a 15% Normal Attack speed boost when his shield is active, which significantly increases damage output for on-field DPS characters who rely on rapid attacks. In summary, Thoma is a versatile and reliable support who thrives in reaction-based teams and with characters that need Pyro application and consistent shielding. He may not be a headliner, but his ability to protect allies, trigger reactions, and enhance Normal Attack-based teams makes him a valuable and dependable asset. Whether you\u2019re crafting a Burgeon core or simply looking for a stylish, red-clad fixer to back up your frontliners, Thoma brings warmth, security, and tactical flexibility to your roster."}, {"question": "Tell me about Dendro Traveler", "answer": "The Dendro Traveler marks a significant evolution in the Traveler's capabilities, introduced with the Sumeru region in *Genshin Impact*. This version of the Traveler brings with them access to the Dendro element\u2014a powerful enabler for a variety of elemental reactions that revolve around nature, growth, and catalysis. Unlike previous versions, Dendro Traveler is a strong and relevant unit even for endgame content, thanks to their ability to consistently trigger and support reactions like Bloom, Hyperbloom, Aggravate, and Quicken. As such, their role is often that of an enabler or support, designed to weave Dendro into nearly any team composition. The core of Dendro Traveler\u2019s playstyle lies in their synergy with elemental reactions. Their Elemental Skill, **Razorgrass Blade**, deals AoE Dendro damage in a straight line and has a short cooldown, making it reliable for continuous Dendro application. It's simple but effective for starting reactions and proccing Electro- or Hydro-based responses. However, it\u2019s their Elemental Burst, **Surgent Manifestation**, that truly defines their power. This ability creates a **Lea Lotus Lamp**, a field that pulses with Dendro damage over time and reacts to the element it comes into contact with. If Electro touches the lamp, its attack speed increases, making it better for Aggravate/Spread teams. If Hydro interacts with it, the AoE of its pulses grows, supporting Bloom-based teams. This flexibility makes Dendro Traveler incredibly adaptable. In terms of team building, Dendro Traveler fits seamlessly into many reaction-based teams, acting as a core enabler in both Hyperbloom (Dendro + Electro + Hydro) and Quicken (Dendro + Electro) comps. They work particularly well alongside characters like Nahida, Kuki Shinobu, Raiden Shogun, Fischl, Xingqiu, Yelan, or even Alhaitham, depending on your goal. In Hyperbloom, for example, Dendro Traveler and Hydro units create Dendro Cores that your Electro unit (like Shinobu) triggers for massive AoE damage. In Aggravate teams, they help consistently trigger Dendro so Electro DPS units can take advantage of reaction-based crit scaling. Artifact-wise, the best set for Dendro Traveler is **Deepwood Memories**. This set not only boosts Dendro damage but also shreds enemy Dendro resistance, which benefits both the Traveler and any other Dendro characters in your team. If another team member is already using Deepwood, Traveler can run **Instructor** (for EM support) or **Noblesse Oblige** for a teamwide ATK buff. Main stats should prioritize Energy Recharge on the Sands (due to their high Burst cost), Dendro Damage Bonus on the Goblet, and Crit Rate, Crit Damage, or Elemental Mastery on the Circlet depending on your build focus. Sub-stats should aim for Energy Recharge, EM, and Crit stats as appropriate. As for weapons, **Favonius Sword** is a top-tier option because it helps generate energy for the whole team and keeps the Burst rotation consistent. **Sapwood Blade**, a craftable Sumeru weapon, is also excellent, giving Energy Recharge and dropping an Elemental Mastery-boosting leaf for the next character that picks it up\u2014perfect for reaction-based teams. Other strong options include **Sacrificial Sword** for an extra Elemental Skill usage or **Freedom-Sworn** if you want to lean into reaction boosting and team buffs. Dendro Traveler's constellations are fairly impactful, and since they\u2019re obtainable for free through story progression, they offer good value. Their early constellations improve the duration and strength of their Elemental Burst, while later ones enhance their Dendro application and reaction support. Notably, Constellation 2 increases the duration of the Lea Lotus Lamp and the buffs it receives based on elements it interacts with, improving your reaction uptime. At Constellation 6, the Traveler begins to provide buffs to the active character\u2019s Elemental Mastery while inside the Lamp\u2019s field, further enhancing reaction damage and cementing their role as a valuable team support. To sum it up, the Dendro Traveler is the most versatile and relevant form of the Traveler to date. They offer strong and reliable Dendro application, team utility, and elemental flexibility, especially in reaction-based teams. Whether you're a new player entering Sumeru or a veteran looking for a consistent Dendro enabler without spending Primogems, the Dendro Traveler is an excellent and free option who punches well above their weight and scales nicely into even the highest-tier team compositions."}, {"question": "Tell me about Electro traveler", "answer": "The Electro Traveler is the Electro-aligned version of the Traveler character, unlocked in *Genshin Impact* after interacting with the Statue of the Seven in Inazuma. While not as flashy as five-star characters, Electro Traveler offers a unique support and battery-focused playstyle that can be quite useful in certain team comps, especially for players looking for reliable Energy Recharge solutions or who are still building out their roster. This version of the Traveler emphasizes consistent Electro application, Energy regeneration, and moderate off-field damage. The Electro Traveler\u2019s playstyle revolves around generating energy and applying Electro damage to support teammates, especially those who have high energy demands. Their Elemental Skill, **Lightning Blade**, unleashes multiple swift strikes that deal Electro damage and generate Abundance Amulets, which, when collected by active characters, restore Energy. This makes them a very effective battery, particularly for other Electro units like Raiden Shogun, Beidou, or Yae Miko. The skill is fast and has a short cooldown, meaning it can be used frequently to both deal damage and sustain team rotations. Their Elemental Burst, **Bellowing Thunder**, summons a thunderous eye that follows the active character. When characters deal Normal or Charged Attack damage, the eye will deal coordinated Electro attacks, acting similarly to other off-field skills like Fischl\u2019s Oz, though with a shorter duration and more modest damage. This Burst is great for sustained Electro application, enabling consistent Electro-related reactions like Overload, Electro-Charged, or Superconduct, depending on the rest of your team. Team-wise, Electro Traveler pairs best in compositions that benefit from energy regeneration or need a reliable off-field Electro applicator. They\u2019re especially helpful in teams where another character has high energy cost abilities and needs consistent energy generation\u2014such as Burst-heavy characters like Eula or Raiden. Because their kit doesn\u2019t rely on heavy stats or hard-to-obtain gear, they can also serve as a placeholder in more developed teams or act as a utility support in early to mid-game. For artifacts, the **Emblem of Severed Fate** set is the best choice, increasing Energy Recharge and scaling Elemental Burst damage based on how much Recharge the Traveler has. A 2-piece mix of Emblem and Thundering Fury or Noblesse Oblige can also work well depending on whether you're leaning into damage or team support. For main stats, prioritize Energy Recharge on the Sands, Electro Damage Bonus on the Goblet, and Crit Rate or Crit Damage on the Circlet. Sub-stats should aim for more Energy Recharge and Crit for balanced output. When it comes to weapons, the **Favonius Sword** is a top-tier choice because it increases Energy generation for the entire team and complements their role as a battery. **Sacrificial Sword** is also great\u2014it gives you a chance to reset the Elemental Skill cooldown and effectively doubles the number of Energy-restoring amulets you can generate. If you\u2019re looking for a more offensive route, **Amenoma Kageuchi** provides Energy generation and some solid attack stats, especially if you're crafting free-to-play weapons. The Electro Traveler\u2019s constellations are relatively easy to obtain and enhance their utility nicely. Constellation 1 increases the number of Abundance Amulets, improving energy generation. Constellation 2 increases the Energy gained from the amulets, further pushing their battery role. Later constellations improve Burst damage and Electro resistance shred, which can help in longer fights or when trying to maximize Electro DPS potential. At C6, they become a surprisingly competent support, offering a mix of utility, energy management, and off-field Electro damage. Overall, while the Electro Traveler may not rival the top-tier supports or Electro DPS units in raw power, they are dependable and highly practical, especially for players without fully built rosters. They shine as a flexible support character with reliable Electro application, excellent energy regeneration, and enough off-field presence to keep your team's flow running smoothly. Whether you're just arriving in Inazuma or looking for an adaptable battery, the Electro Traveler is well worth building."}, {"question": "Tell me about Xianyun", "answer": "Xianyun is a five-star Anemo character who wields a catalyst and stands out in Genshin Impact as a rare example of an Anemo healer and support with a heavy emphasis on aerial mobility and plunge-attack synergy. Inspired by the legendary Cloud Retainer from Liyue lore, Xianyun brings grace, elegance, and the spirit of an adeptus into battle, using her cloud-summoning abilities to support her team both defensively and offensively. Her kit is uniquely tailored to enhance characters that rely on plunging attacks, creating a niche team dynamic that rewards vertical combat and airborne aggression. Xianyun\u2019s playstyle centers around her Elemental Skill and Burst, both of which support teammates and facilitate aerial movement. Her Elemental Skill, White Clouds at Dawn, allows her to leap into the air, granting plunging opportunities and healing based on her attack stat. The skill can be used up to three times in a row, enabling high mobility and creating a platform for plunge-attack-based characters. Her Elemental Burst, Stars Gather at Dusk, summons Cloudfall Skystacks that continuously heal nearby characters and boost their plunge damage, particularly if the team includes an Anemo character. This makes her a perfect support unit for teams focused around characters like Xiao or even more experimental builds like plunging Noelle or certain traveler setups. In team compositions, Xianyun shines brightest when paired with Xiao, whom she was practically made to support. Xiao\u2019s kit revolves entirely around his plunging attacks, and Xianyun enables him to stay in the air longer, heals him to offset the HP drain from his Burst, and buffs his plunge damage through her own abilities. She also works well with Faruzan to create a triple Anemo core that maximizes Anemo damage while leaving room for a shielder or buffer like Zhongli or Bennett. Outside of Xiao, Xianyun can be used with other characters who benefit from aerial setups, though the synergy isn\u2019t always as natural. When it comes to artifact sets, Xianyun\u2019s best option is the four-piece Vourukasha\u2019s Glow, which increases healing and boosts skill and burst damage after taking damage or healing, synergizing well with her healing-centric kit. Alternatively, Noblesse Oblige can be used to boost the team\u2019s overall attack, especially if another team member isn't using it already. For main stats, you\u2019ll want to focus on ATK% for the Sands, Anemo Damage Bonus or HP% on the Goblet depending on build, and Crit Rate/Crit Damage or Healing Bonus on the Circlet. Building her with high ATK is ideal if you want to maximize both her healing output and her plunge damage buffs. Xianyun has several good weapon options. Her signature five-star weapon, Crane\u2019s Echoing Call, is best in slot, increasing her healing and providing buffs to plunge attack damage. If you don't have access to her signature weapon, Prototype Amber is an excellent free-to-play alternative that enhances healing and restores energy. Favonius Codex can also be used if energy generation is a priority, though it contributes less to her overall healing or support potential. Since she scales heavily off of attack, even a weapon like Skyward Atlas can work in hybrid builds, but her best performance is with those that directly support healing or plunging synergies. Xianyun\u2019s constellations significantly enhance her support capabilities and flexibility. Her first constellation increases the number of Elemental Skill charges and boosts her healing further, allowing her to keep characters like Xiao alive and constantly airborne. Later constellations improve her energy generation and further increase the damage boost she gives to plunge attacks. Her sixth constellation turns her into a partial DPS by allowing her to unleash damage through coordinated attacks, but she\u2019s already a fully functional and valuable support at C0, especially in Xiao teams. To sum it up, Xianyun is a beautiful fusion of elegance and utility\u2014a character designed for a very specific purpose but with the versatility to fit into creative team comps. Her ability to heal, enhance plunge attacks, and create vertical combat opportunities adds a unique dimension to team-building in Genshin Impact. For players who love Xiao or want to explore more dynamic air-based combat styles, she is an invaluable and stylish support who transforms how your team interacts with the battlefield."}, {"question": "Tell me about Xiao", "answer": "Xiao is a five-star Anemo polearm user known for his high mobility and aggressive playstyle centered around plunging attacks. As a vigilant Yaksha and guardian of Liyue, his story is steeped in duty and solitude, but on the battlefield, he becomes a whirlwind of destruction. Xiao\u2019s role is firmly that of a main DPS, and his kit is designed for sustained personal damage, allowing him to dominate the field with rapid, high-powered Anemo plunges that tear through groups of enemies and bosses alike. Xiao\u2019s core mechanic lies in his Elemental Burst, Bane of All Evil, which transforms him into a demonic form that dramatically increases his jump height, converts his attacks to Anemo damage, and boosts his attack power. While in this state, he can spam plunging attacks that deal massive AoE Anemo damage. However, there\u2019s a tradeoff\u2014Xiao continually loses HP while his Burst is active, requiring a steady flow of healing to keep him alive. His Elemental Skill, Lemniscatic Wind Cycling, lets him dash forward in a flash of wind, damaging enemies in his path. This skill can be used up to three times in quick succession at higher constellations and is useful both for damage and repositioning. Xiao\u2019s team composition needs to be carefully built around his strengths and weaknesses. Because he relies so heavily on his Elemental Burst and loses HP over time, pairing him with a good healer is essential. Characters like Jean or Bennett work beautifully\u2014Jean, in particular, is ideal due to her Anemo synergy and strong healing. Faruzan is another excellent teammate, as she can shred enemy Anemo resistance and boost Xiao\u2019s damage significantly. Zhongli is also a top-tier partner, offering a powerful shield and resistance shred to keep Xiao safe while he plunges into battle. Artifact-wise, Xiao\u2019s best set is the four-piece Viridescent Venerer for early to mid-game players, but once you reach late game, a more optimal set is two pieces of Viridescent Venerer and two of Gladiator\u2019s Finale or Shimenawa\u2019s Reminiscence for an Anemo and ATK% mix. His main stats should focus on ATK% on the Sands, Anemo Damage Bonus on the Goblet, and Crit Rate or Crit Damage on the Circlet, depending on your weapon. Energy Recharge is also helpful, but not at the cost of damage\u2014Xiao\u2019s rotations are energy-hungry, but his damage ceiling is too high to sacrifice offensive stats completely. Xiao\u2019s best weapon is the five-star polearm Primordial Jade Winged-Spear, which increases Crit Rate and boosts his attack after hitting enemies. Staff of Homa is another extremely powerful choice, especially since it benefits from the HP drain during his Burst and boosts Crit Damage. For four-star options, Deathmatch (from the Battle Pass) or Blackcliff Pole (from the Starglitter shop) are viable, especially when built with a proper Crit stat balance. Prototype Starglitter can be used if you're desperate for Energy Recharge, but it\u2019s far from ideal for his damage-focused kit. Xiao\u2019s constellations significantly enhance his quality of life and damage potential, though he\u2019s perfectly viable at C0. His first constellation gives him an extra charge of his Elemental Skill, which smooths out his energy generation and adds more flexibility during combat. His second constellation increases his Energy Recharge, helping with uptime on his Burst. The most notable constellation is C6, which removes the cooldown on his Skill during his Burst, drastically increasing his damage output and mobility\u2014but this is a luxury, not a necessity. In summary, Xiao is a dynamic and self-sufficient main DPS who rewards aggressive, fast-paced gameplay and excels at tearing through enemies with relentless plunging attacks. He does require specific support to function at his best, especially in terms of healing and energy generation, but when properly supported, he becomes one of the most devastating characters in the game. For players who enjoy high-impact, aerial combat and solo-carry style gameplay, Xiao is an incredibly satisfying and powerful choice."}, {"question": "Tell me about Yun jin", "answer": "Yun Jin is a unique four-star Geo character who wields a polearm and serves primarily as a support unit that boosts the Normal Attack damage of her teammates. As the head of the Yun-Han Opera Troupe in Liyue, she brings grace and elegance not just to the stage but also to the battlefield. Unlike many supports who enhance damage through elemental reactions, Yun Jin\u2019s strength lies in her ability to buff allies regardless of their element or reaction potential, making her extremely versatile and especially powerful when paired with characters that rely heavily on Normal Attacks. Yun Jin\u2019s playstyle is centered around her Elemental Skill and Burst, which work together to both protect her and enhance the damage output of the main DPS. Her Elemental Skill, Opening Flourish, allows her to enter a defensive stance and then unleash a counterattack based on her defense stat if timed correctly. While it does offer some utility, it\u2019s her Elemental Burst, Cliffbreaker\u2019s Banner, that defines her as a support. When activated, it grants all nearby party members a Normal Attack damage bonus based on Yun Jin\u2019s defense and the number of different elements present in your party. This makes her an ideal partner for mono-element teams or those built around Normal Attack-centric characters. The best teammates for Yun Jin are those who deal most of their damage through Normal Attacks. Characters like Yoimiya, Ayato, Noelle (as DPS), and Razor benefit greatly from her buff. She also pairs well with characters like Fischl or Childe in specific setups. Since her buff does not rely on reactions or energy synergy, she fits comfortably into many team compositions and allows players to try out unique builds that aren\u2019t reliant on traditional elemental reaction-based playstyles. For artifacts, the best set for Yun Jin is the Husk of Opulent Dreams, which significantly boosts her defense and Geo damage, both of which scale her Burst effectiveness. You can also use a two-piece combo of Defender\u2019s Will and Husk for an early-game or budget option. Her main stats should focus on Energy Recharge on the Sands, DEF% on the Goblet, and DEF% or Crit Rate/Crit Damage on the Circlet depending on the weapon and playstyle. Energy Recharge is also important because you want to use her Burst frequently to keep the buff active. When it comes to weapons, Yun Jin performs best with polearms that provide Energy Recharge or DEF. The Favonius Lance is a great four-star option, helping her maintain high uptime on her Burst. Prototype Starglitter is a good craftable option, and if you have it, Engulfing Lightning is excellent for increasing Energy Recharge and boosting her Burst frequency. You can also use The Catch if you\u2019re running her in more Burst-focused comps, though it may be overkill depending on the rest of your team. Yun Jin\u2019s constellations offer strong quality-of-life improvements and enhance her supportive abilities. Her first constellation increases her Normal Attack buff uptime, while her second one increases her Burst's effectiveness. The most impactful one is her sixth constellation, which increases the Normal Attack Speed of your teammates when under her Burst\u2019s effect, adding a significant damage boost in the right hands. However, she works well even at C0, and players don\u2019t need to chase constellations unless they\u2019re looking to optimize her performance or use her as a staple in multiple teams. In short, Yun Jin is a powerful and elegant support character whose unique defense-scaling mechanics and universal Normal Attack buff open up interesting and flexible team compositions. While she doesn\u2019t deal massive damage on her own, her presence greatly amplifies the output of the right DPS characters, making her an excellent choice for players looking to build around Normal Attack-heavy playstyles or who enjoy mixing creativity into their team building."}, {"question": "Tell me about Venti", "answer": "Venti is one of the original five-star characters in Genshin Impact and is an incredibly powerful and versatile Anemo (Wind) support character who wields a bow. As the mortal vessel of Barbatos, the Anemo Archon of Mondstadt, Venti brings a light-hearted, poetic charm to the story, often seen singing or causing mischief. But beyond his carefree demeanor lies a very potent crowd control specialist, making him one of the strongest supports in the game, particularly in battles involving large groups of enemies. Venti\u2019s playstyle revolves around his Elemental Skill and Burst, which allow him to gather enemies into a small area, enabling your other characters to deal massive area-of-effect (AoE) damage. His Elemental Skill, Skyward Sonnet, has two forms: a tap version that launches enemies into the air and a charged version that lifts Venti himself with an upcurrent. However, it\u2019s his Elemental Burst, Wind\u2019s Grand Ode, that truly defines his combat utility. This ability summons a massive Stormeye that continuously pulls in enemies and absorbs elements like Pyro, Cryo, Electro, or Hydro if they come into contact with it, creating swirling reactions that amplify your team\u2019s elemental damage output significantly. When building a team around Venti, you\u2019ll want to pair him with characters that can capitalize on the grouping effect of his Burst. Characters like Xiangling, Ayaka, or Ganyu can dish out devastating AoE damage that synergizes perfectly with Venti\u2019s crowd control. His Swirl reactions also reduce enemy resistances with the right artifact set, further boosting team DPS. He works particularly well in mob-heavy content like the Spiral Abyss, though he can struggle slightly against heavy or boss-type enemies that cannot be pulled by his Burst. In terms of artifact sets, the Viridescent Venerer set is by far the best choice for Venti. It boosts Anemo damage and significantly enhances Swirl reactions while reducing enemy resistance to the swirled element, making your elemental DPS characters hit much harder. For main stats, you\u2019ll want to focus on Energy Recharge or Elemental Mastery on the Sands, Anemo Damage Bonus on the Goblet, and Crit Rate or Crit Damage on the Circlet, depending on the weapon you choose. If you build him with Elemental Mastery, you\u2019ll maximize his Swirl damage; if you go the crit route, you can take more advantage of his Anemo damage directly. Venti has several strong weapon options. His best-in-slot weapon is the five-star bow Elegy for the End, which boosts Energy Recharge and provides an Elemental Mastery buff to the team after triggering Elemental Reactions. It complements his supportive role beautifully. Other solid choices include The Stringless, which boosts Elemental Skill and Burst damage, and Favonius Warbow, which helps with energy generation. For a free-to-play option, Windblume Ode is viable, especially with an Elemental Mastery build. Venti's constellations are not necessary for him to function well\u2014he's incredibly strong even at C0\u2014but they do offer some fun bonuses. His first constellation restores energy for Venti and other party members after using his Burst, which can help in tight rotations. Higher constellations improve his crowd control and damage, but since he\u2019s already top-tier out of the gate, most players don\u2019t need to invest in them unless they\u2019re fans or want to maximize his potential. Overall, Venti is an essential asset for players who enjoy efficient crowd control and setting up high-damage elemental reactions. He offers an elegant and smooth playstyle, sweeping enemies into the sky while your team rains devastation down on them. For new players, investing in Venti means ensuring a much easier time dealing with large groups of enemies throughout the game."}]
